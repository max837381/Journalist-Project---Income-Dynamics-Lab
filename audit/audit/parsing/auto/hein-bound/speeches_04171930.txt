710177396|Will the gentleman yield?
710177397|I yield.
710177398|I could not hear the gentleman plainly. but I understand that he desires to extend the tubercular patients up to 1930. and that was his attitude before the committee.
710177399|Will the gentleman Include neuropsychiatric patients?
710177400|I have not included them. I will say that I followed the agreement that was entered into between us in the committee. The amendment I shall offer was drafted by the Veterans Bureau. The gentleman will remember that on that the committee stood 9 and 9 on our agreed amendment to the Johnson bill. This amendment I propose embodies our agreement.
710177401|Now. I want to ask the gentleman from Ohio a further question: Is it not a fact that the strongest appeal for any legislation at all comes with reference to the tubercular men?
710177402|Yes. I think that I have already stated that.
710177403|I did not hear it.
710177404|That is my reason for extending the amendment to the tubercular men alone. which provides that the rate of compensation for all cases to be given compensation by reason of this bill shall be 60 per cent of the present rate. when the service connection rests upon presumption alone. This discrimination ought to be made in the very beginning. Just the moment we attempt any legislation which seeks to give relief to disabled veterans whose disabilities are in no way the result of their service. so soon should we make a distinction in the amount of the relief. It should not make a difference that the service pension is given in the guise of compensation. To do otherwise would be calculated to arouse resentment on the part of Civil War and our Spanish War veterans and their friends. If we adopt my amendment and pay these new presumptive cases on the basis of 60 per cent of the present rates. stillowe are treating World War veterans more liberally than those of any other war. Sixty per cent will be gladly received by those who now get nothing. but how serious must be the problem if ever. on an attempt to adjust and harmonize our veteran relief legislation. we would seek to cut down the rate of a pension once granted.
710177405|Will the gentleman yield?
710177406|Has the gentleman any informa:tion as to how many of these tubercular cases will be included in his amendment?
710177407|I have not the figures. I have an estimate of the expense given by General Hines. in which he said the cost would be $8.700.000 for advancing the presumptive date to January 1. 1930. for tubercular cases alone. With reference to paying the additional 10 per cent to those who have disabilities caused by conflict with the enemy. in battle. the expense would be $2.800.000 a year. The extras therefore carried in the amendment. as I have prepared it. would total $11.500.000. and so there would be a saving over the Johnson bill as it now stands of $18.900.000. at least.
710177408|I was not aware when I interrupted the gentleman that he proposed to incorporate his amendment In the RECORD. so that we would know exactly what he has suggested.
710177409|My proposed amendment will be printed in the RECORD. As my amendment restates the entire section 10. I thought it more easy of comprehension if I would explain the three features. The 10 per cent extra for those actually wounded and disabled in battle may be considered sentimental and not especially called for. but it forms the basis for the differentiation in treatment between those who have contributed in different measure to the preservation and advancement of this wonderful country which we are enjoying today.
710177410|Mr. Chairman. will the gentleman yield?
710177411|The gentleman has made an informing and interesting statement. which. I am sure. every Member of the House will read with profit. and I ask in that connection that the gentleman call attention to the letter written by General Hines to the chairman of the Committee on Rules. which also contains constructive comments and suggestions. I appreciate the spirit in which the gentleman has discussed this legislation. as. I am sure. do other Members of the House. It has not been in criticism of either the gentleman from Mississippi or the gentleman from South Dakota . both of whom I feel wish to do the right thing for the veterans.
710177412|I thank the gentleman from Alabama very much. It was his appearance before the Veterans Committee and the splendid presentation of the wrongs that have been endured by veterans because of the arbitrary regulation 73 that impelled me to go as far as I have with reference to these cases of tuberculosis. I stand here in a very peculiar attitude in seeking to amend this bill in a way which will actually save $18.700.000 a year. and yet I do it feeling it should be done before we go further with legislation which is certainly of a pension nature.
710177413|Will the gentlemans amendment make any provision for those veterans who are totally and permanently disabled regardless of the source or the time of their disability?
710177414|No. By my amendment I take the Johnson bill as I find it. It is broader and more liberal than the Rankin bill. because it includes all cases of disability of all diseases up to the 1st of January. 1925. Then my amendment goes further. and takes the liberal provision of the bill suggested by Mr. RANIIN. extending the period for the presumption of service connection for tuberculosis cases to the 1st of January. 19.30. but it does not take care of the soldiers who may be totally disabled. whose disability arises after the 1st of January. 1925. and has no connection with their service.
710177415|Does not the gentleman think that we have quite a large number of veterans who are totally and permanently disabled. who are unable to connect their disability with the service. and who are now objects of charity. who ought to be cared for in this bill?
710177416|Absolutely. The gentleman can readily see that it would be an extraordinary case that would not develop before the 1st of January. 1925. when the war was really over in 1919.
710177417|I just had a report from the Veterans Bureau which says that there are 2.974 veterans who are totally disabled at the present time. who are permanently disabled. and yet they are unable to connect their disability with the service. I know that in my district. and the gentleman knows that in his district. there are one or two or more who are objects of charity and who have been objects of charity for 8 or 10 years. and I feel that there ought to be some provision in this bill to take care of these deserving soldiers.
710177418|My colleague puts this sympafhetically. but the gentleman realizes that there are so many of these cases in which he and I rush to the Veterans Bureau and find that the man. perhaps. has been sent down to Camp Sherman and had been there for three days and had been sent back because they found that he had this particular disability and could not be of service. and then when that man comes and asks for.my help my entlusiasm sometimes wanes a little when I think of real soldiers disabled and in misery who really deserve and by their service have merited relief. I add a copy of the letter General Hines referred to. with a statement of costs involved and showing a saving of $18.900.000 a year over the Johnson bill as it now stands:
710177419|Mr. Chairman. I yield 20 minutes to the gentleman from Oklahoma .
710177420|"Mr. Chairman. I have been very much interested in the debate this afternoon in connection with the pending bill to liberalize the World War veterans act. I think a majority of the Members of this House. and I am sure all the disabled exservice men of the country. will agree that the veterans act needs far more liberalizing than is proposed or contemplated in the pending commaittee measure. The present law. written to cope with the situation in 1924. is entirely out of date in 1930. The pending bill does not give the relief that I had confidently expected. but it will correct some of the evils of the old law. slash the red tape in thousands of claims. and be a forward step in meeting the Nations obligations to her disabled soldiers. I am going to support it. because I feel that it is much better than no legislation at all. To say. however. that your bill meets the demands of the American Legion. Veterans of Foreign Wars. and other service mens organizations is preposterous. To urge that this bill will relieve anything like all worthy claims of our disabled veterans is not in keeping with the facts. But even if this committee bill does not do much more than skim the surface as far as the urgent needs are concerned. and even though it denies service connection to thousands of tubercular and mental cases. it is. nevertheless. significant that every dollar paid under its terms will go to the disabled veteran or his wife. widow. orphans. or other dependents. I feel that it should pass without a dissenting vote. with the Rankin amendment. if possible. but by all means pass the bill in some form. This Government has too long delayed doing justice by our disabled veterans. who are growing impatient under endless red tape. extravagance. and incompetency. In following the discussion thus far upon the floor relative to the committee bill. and especially the speeches I have heard with reference to the proposed Rankin amendment to the bill. the outstanding argument against the passage of this legislation is the enormous expense. Some have placed the estimate of cost of this measure. with or without the Rankin amendment. at approximately $100.000.000. No one seems to know what it will be. The best evidence appears to be that of General Hines. Director of the Veterans Bureau. who first estimated the Rankin bill at $48.000.000. and later. I believe. changed his figures to $44.000.000. General Hines also estimated that some 77.000 cases would come under the Rankin bill. or amendment. Now it is a significant fact. as brought out in the hearings. that more than 23.000 mental cases included in the Rankin bill would be absolutely barred under the committee measure. In addition to that. more than 18.000 tubercular cases that the Rankin amendment proposes to care for would fail to come under your committee measure. I do not care to hazard a guess at what it will cost the Government under either measure. but I can not conceive of this Congress connecting all claims of all veterans who have disabilities of 10 per cent up to the year of 1925. and. at the same time. refusing to recognize more than 40.000 tubercular and mental cases merely because they did not file their claims before 1925. Inasmuch as opponents of this legislation insist upon discussing the cost of caring for the disabled veterans. permit me to remind Members of the House that you have passed many bills here for more than $100.000.000 without a roll call. A few weeks ago this House voted to spend $230.000.000 for public buildings. and not a protest. as I recall. was raised against the bill. Early in the present session of Congress a law was passed returning to the big interests of the country $190.000.000 of income taxes. Some one has raised the point that if this bill is passed. Congress will be compelled to repeal the law refunding $190.000.000 income taxes. This. to my mind. is abundant reason for this legislation. Why not let those millionaires who profiteered to the tune of 500 to 700 per cent during the World War. while our soldier boys worked for $1 a day. help pay cost of this legislation for these disabled and helpless veterans? Last December this House voted to relieve France of $407.000.000 of indebtedness to the United States. Some of you who are now opposing this bill stood on the floor of the House and pleaded eloquently for ""poor povertystricken France."" You were anxious to relieve France of the debt of $407.000.000 which she owed the American people. in order to show your ""brotherly love."" but to the thousands of our own American soldiers who lost their health in France and who are today looking to this Congress for their very existence. you turn a deaf ear. put your hands on your pocketbooks. with the flimsy excuse that it will cost too much money. Mr. Chairman. in the early part of the present session of Congress I introduced a number of bills to amend the World War veterans ""ict. looking to the relief of our disabled soldiers. Inasmnuch as I may offer further criticism of the pending bill before concluding my remarks. which criticism I trust will be constructive. permit me to say I am delighted to find. after scrutinizing the committee bill. that certain provisions of my measures are incorporated in part in it. Since I shall not hesitate to criticize: the weakness of the pending bill. I want to say in all fairness that it has several commendable features. some of which I desire to mention. For example. the committee bill. when passed. will be of assistance to those tubercular cases filed before 1925. many of which have been turned down. If there was nothing else in your bill except section 13. that proposes to amend subdivision 7. section 102. of the 1924 act. I would favor the bill. provided. of course. we can do no better. If you will turn to page 22. line 10. you will find it reads: That any exservice person shown to have had a tuberculous disease of service origin. whether active or otherwise. shall receive compensation of not less than $50 per month. I am also inhearty accord with a further provision to pay the wife of a veteran in a hospital suffering with- tuberculosis and whose income is less than $1.000 per year compensation at the rate of $30 per month. a wife and child of such hospital patient. $40 per month. with $5 for each additional child. The bill further provides additional time for the filing of application for disability compensation. Concerning misconduct cases heretofore disallowed the committee bill provides thatNo person suffering from paralysis. paresis. or blindness shall be denied compensation by reason of willful misconduct. The cumbersome insurance law. with all of its red tape. has also been somewhat broadened and clarified. and it is hoped that it will not be necessary to employ additional attorneys to interpret its meaning. My bill. H. R. 7766. provided thatVeterans suffering with chronic diseases which competent medical judgment indicates was incurred. increased. or aggravated in the service. such chronic diseases shall be held to be of service origin or aggravation. notwithstanding the lack of historical affirmative evidence. Immediately after introducing my bill I followed my usual course of asking for a hearing. Not only did I request a hearing on H. R. 7766 but also on the several other measures I introduced for the relief of disabled war veterans. I was not accorded a hearing on any of these bills. but I am not complaining about that. I have understood that this socaled omnibus committee bill would take care of all necessary veterans legislation. The Veterans Committee has labored tirelessly for weeks and months and is to be commended for its sincere. unselfish efforts. However. in looking over its bill very carefully I fail to find a paragraph. a sentence. or syllable favoring the admission of competent medical evidence in establishing claims of our disabled veterans. Your committee bill is as silent as the sphinx of the desert on the question of admission of evidence of the local doctors by bureau officials in establishing disability claims. I have no desire to criticize the Veterans Bureau unjustly. I have prosecuted many claims before the bureau. and. as a rule. my claims have been successful. It has some 24.000 employees. and a majority of those I have come in contact with. from the director down. have impressed me as being highclass men and women and thoroughly capable. But all of us know that one of the most severe and oftrepeated criticisms heard on the floor of the House against the Veterans Bureau is the fact that so little consideration is given to affidavits furnished veterans by local doctors. Under the present rule and practice the bureau has employed too many young fellows not long out of school. many of whom have had little or no actual experience. The pay. as I recall. is about $3.000 per year. No one expects competent medical men for that small salary. It is very difficult to secure successful practitioners for $3.000 per year. These school boys. as a rule. know just enough to find fault with the diagnosis of the competent local physician. The claim of the veteran is promptly turned down because the local doctor did not go into detail and use a lot of highsounding medical terms that a layman could not understand. For example. this morning I appeared before the division of appeals of the Veterans Bureau on a tubercular case appealed from the regional office In my State. The record of the case disclosed that the veteran had a hospital record while in the Army. that he was suffering from acute bronchitis at the time of discharge. and that only a few months thereafter a wellknown local doctor residing in the district I have the honor to represent diagnosed his case as pulmonary tuberculosis. stating that the claimant was having frequent hemorrhages. with subnormal temperature.. Three other physicians whom I know personally. and whose ability and integrity are beyond question. also examined him during the years of 1922. 1924. and 1929. and each found the patient suffering from active pulmonary tuberculosis. and so diagnosed the case. Even an insurance company rejected his application as soon after the veterans discharge as 1920 on account of his weak lungs and bad heart. as determined by an X ray. This poor fellow. who weighed 172 pounds piior to his enlistment. is today a walking skeleton and absolutely unable to perform a days labor. He is one of the thousands who refused to file a claim against his Government as long as he was physically able to do work. even part of the time. When first examined by bureau doctors in 1929 his case was diagnosed as chronic pulmonary tuberculosis. far advanced ""B"" active. In a little over 30 days thereafter. however. other alleged bureau physicians. after a supposedtobe examination. found. or. rather. the record states they found. ""no disease of chest found."" Shortly thereafter the claim of this veteran was disallowed. The inconsistency. incompetency. and utter lack of sympathy for the veteran on the part of some of the bureau physicians is absolutely appalling."
710177421|Mr. Chairman. will the gentleman yield?
710177422|Did I understand the gentleman to say that the veteran had not filed his claim until 1929?
710177423|Yes. that is the case. He had not filed his claim until 1929. although four competent local doctors who examined him gave clear and convincing evidence that lie has had tuberculosis for 10 years at least.
710177424|Then that case would not come under the Johnson bill?
710177425|No. that case and thousands of other similar cases could not possibly come under the Johnson bill if it is passed without amendment.
710177426|Then that appears to be a good argument for the socalled Rankin bill?
710177427|"I think it is a very good argument for the Rankin bill. and I am cerli n there are thousands of other cases similar to this in the districts of every Member of Congress. Often we have heard here the Pension Bureau compared with the Veterans Bureau by Members of Congress. and it is an open secret that the Veterans Bureau always suffers sadly by the comparison. The Commissioner of Pensions accepts the findings of a competent local doctor. That has not only proved satisfactory but has eliminated much expense. and the taxpayers are certainly entitled to some consideration in the enactment of this legislation. On the other hand. if a World War veteran can comply with sufficient red tape to secure a medical examination by the bureau. he Is sent to his nearest regional office at Government expense. He waits in line for hours and sometimes days. and then. too often. faces one of the bureaus socalled doctors. who would not know a shrapnel wound from an ingrowing toenail. The embryonic. supposedtobe doctor looks wise and gives the veteran an alleged examination. He seems to delight in telling the veteran there is positively nothing wrong with him. In some instances I have known bureau doctors to lecture veterans and even scold them for taking up their valuable time. I have one case in mind where a disabled soldier who was suffering severely with a pain in his side was scolded and referred to as ""1a tramp"" and ""dead beat"" by the examining bureau doctor. He was sent home and not long thereafter died of the disability of which he complained and had appealed many times to the bureau for relief. I refer to a personal friend who died because of criminal negligence of a United States Veterans Bureau medical officer. Can you imagine such a thingone of our disabled soldiers held up to contempt and scorn by one of these bureau doctors and called "" a tramp"" and ""a dead beat ""? Shortly afterwards this soldier died of the disability he complained of and I had the sad and painful duty of being one of his pallbearers."
710177428|Mr. Chairman. will the gentlemen yield?
710177429|Will the Johnson bill do anything for that mans widow and children?
710177430|I am sure it would not if lie had any.
710177431|Will the Rankin bill do anything for his widow and children?
710177432|I am not sure about that.
710177433|When did the man die?
710177434|About two years ago. July. 1928. I believe.
710177435|The Veterans Bureau denied his claim?
710177436|Yes. for many months prior to his last illness his claim was denied. But. may I add. that after the veteran died the bureau suddenly decided that the bureau doctors were wrong and allowed the claim. and his dependent mother was granted a small allowance.
710177437|That will not help the man now?
710177438|No. it will not help him now. but the point I want to convey is that. under the present law and under the Johnson bill. little or no consideration is given to the evidence of competent local doctors.
710177439|This is entirely a presumptive bill. If the man is disabled. he is presumed to have incurred his disabilities in the service. The gentleman says he is for the socalled Rankin amendment. because it will help more people?
710177440|Yes. I am for the Rankin bill. because I think it will take care of the innumerable tuberculosis and mental cases who filed their claims since 1925. and who are absolutely ignored in your bill.
710177441|How does the gentleman come to the conclusion that the Rankin bill. with an expenditure of $47.000.000. would take care of more men than the Johnson bill. with an expenditure of $100.000.000?
710177442|Frankly. I think the gentleman is begging the question. He very well knows I quoted figures from the sworn testimony of Director Hines. Granting that the gentlemans bill will take care of more cases up until 1925. I submit tha t Congress can not afford to ignore the 40.000 mental and tuberculosis .cases. Those figures are in the record. I am of the opinion. however. that neither the director nor the gentleman from South Dakota have any definite information as to what his bill will cost. Permit me to say further to the gentleman from South Dakota that I am for his bill. but let me suggest to him and other Members of the House that the Rankin amendment would greatly strengthen his bill. It would be a happy compromise to adopt the Johnson bill. that takes care of all cases up to 1925. and then add the Rankin amendment. to care for the many tuberculosis and mental cases that would not come under the Johnson bill.
710177443|The time of the gentleman from Oklahoma has expired.
710177444|Mr. Chairman. inasmuch as I have been interrupted several times. I would like to have a little more time.
710177445|Mr. Chairman. I yield 10 minutes more to the gentleman.
710177446|The gentleman from Oklahoma is recognized for 10 minutes more.
710177447|Mr. Chairman. will the gentleman yield?
710177448|Yes. I will be glad to yield again to the gentleman from Missouri.
710177449|The gentleman says he is In favor of the Rankin bill because it will take care of these additional cases.
710177450|Answering. I will say that the Rankin amendment provides for all chronic or constitutional cases who file their claims before 1930.
710177451|Provided that the. Veterans Bureau does not prove that the man was not disabled during the time of his service. The only way to reach a case like that is by the passage of the Swick bill. or the bill I introduced two years ago.
710177452|Permit me to suggest to my colleague from Missouri that neither his bill nor the Swick measure is before the House at this time. If this bill is not full and broad enough. I shall be glad to assist my good friend in passing the Swick bill c.- some other meritorious measure.
710177453|The gentleman must know that the President would probably veto such a bill.
710177454|I will say to the gentleman that I do not know that. neither does he. I do not pretend to speak for the President. But I must add that during my limited experience in Congress I have never seen so many who professed to be spokesman for the President.
710177455|Mr. Chairman. will the gentleman yield?
710177456|Yes. I am delighted to yield to the able gentleman from Mississippi.
710177457|The Johnson bill will cost more than the Rankin bill because the Rankin bill would be limited to those cases to the rating of the schedule of the Veterans Bureau. but the Johnson bill leaves out the tubercular men and the neuropsychiatric men. By the Rankin bill we will reach more men who are in a serious condition and at a cost of less money.
710177458|"I thank the gentleman from Mississippi for his contribution. I am informed by an official of the United States Veterans Bureau. hi whom I have confidence. that my competent medical evidence bill. if passed. would connect many thousands of worthy cases of disabled veterans that have been disallowed under the existing law. I submit for the earnest consideration of this House that an amendment incorporating the competent medicaljudgment provisions should. in fairness to the veterans. be written into this socalled omnibus measure. Another section of my bill. which I was unable to get a hearing on. provided for the admission of ""lay"" evidence. or. in other words. evidence from a disabled veterans comrades and friends. I note this bill provides that "" due consideration shall be given lay evidence."" Those words ""due consideration"""
710177459|The time of the gentleman from Oklahoma has again expired.
710177460|Will the Chairman advise the members of the committee how much more general debate remains on the )ill?
710177461|The gentleman from South Dakota has 2 hours and 11 minutes remaining. the gentleman from Mississippi has 3 hours and 19 minutes remaining.
710177462|Mr. Chairman. I move that the committee do now rise.
710177463|Mr. Speaker. I ask unanimous consent to extend my remarks on the subject of G. A. R. pensions.
710177464|The gentleman from Massachusetts asks unanimous consent to extend his remarks on the subject of G. A. R. pensions. Is there objection?
710177465|Mr. Speaker. at this time. when we are considering a measure providing additional relief for our World War veterans. I want to say a word in behalf of certain legislation now pending before the Committee on Invalid Pensions providing additional relief for the veterans of our Civil War and their widows. The number of Civil War veterans now surviving is a little less than 53.000. of an average age of 86 years. They are passing away at the rate of about 12.000 a year. The actual death rate for the month of March this year was 984. so that within three or four years more in all probability only a few will be with us. The number of Civil War widows now living is a little over 150.000. of an average age of 75. They are also passing away at a rapid rateabout 21.000 a year. with the actual death rate for the month of March of 1.804. If there is to be any additional relief furnished by this Government to these veterans and their widows. it must be passed at this session in order to be of any practical benefit. The proposed bill . which was introduced by me. embodies the legislative program of the Grand Army of the Republic and is sponsored and approved by that organization. Briefly. it provides that every Civil War veteran who is now receiving $05 a month shall receive $72. those now receiving $72 a month shall receive $90 a month. and those now receiving $90 a month shall be given $125 a month. The bill further provides that any widow of a Civil War veteran shall receive $50 a month. irrespective of her age. with the proviso that it shall not apply to the widow of any veteran whose marriage may take place subsequent to the date of approval of this bill. if enacted into law. Under the present law only those widows whose marriage took place prior to June 27. 1905. are eligible for a pension. and APRm 17 then only at the rate of $30 a month. unless by special act. There are about 55.000 widows now receiving $30 a month and about 98.000 receiving $40 a month as a result of the recent amendment providing for this increase to widows 75 years of age or over. It is estimated that there would be about 5.000 additional widows entitled to pension as a result of changing the date of eligibility from June 27. 1905. to the date of the enactment of this bill into law. The additional expense involved. if this legislation were enacted. is estimated by the Commissioner of Pensions at approximately $38.000.000 annually. with a reduction on account of •estimated death losses of about $3.400.000 a year. making the net cost the initial year about $34.657.472. Of the gross amount. the additional expense necessitated as a result of increase in amounts provided for the veterans themselves would be about $9.827.112 annually. and the additional expense necessitated as a result of the increase in amounts provided for those widows who were married prior to June 27. 1905. would be about $25.230.360 annually. An approximate amount of $3.400.000 would be added to this for those widows who married since that date and are not now eligible for pension. but who would become so if this bill were enacted into law. Surely if we are to do anything more for these few surviving Civil War veterans and their widows now is the psychological time to act. before it is too late for any such additional financial recognition to be of benefit. No fairminded person but must agree that this country has been generous to its veterans and their dependents. It has every reason to be. I think we will all agree. and gladly so. Personally. I am in hearty accord with any plan which may be evolved for handling the whole question of our obligation to our veterans of all wars on a scientific basis. so that there may be no question ever raised of discriminationbetween veterans of different wars in respect to their individual treatment. All men who have fought for their country in any war and have hazarded their health. their opportunity of earning a livelihood. and their lives should be treated exactly alike. Until such a plan may be worked out we can not be unmindful of our obligation to these few remaining survivors of the war that was fought to save the very existence of this country.
710177466|Mr. Speaker. I ask unanimous consent to extend my remarks on the work of the rural mail carriers.
710177467|The gentleman from New York asks unanimous consent to extend his remarks on the work of the rural mail carriers. Is there objection?
710177468|Mr. Speaker. it appears that a great amount of pressure Is being brought to bear in Congress against the interests of the rural mail carriers. Many Members who are not familiar with the duties of the rural carriers or the net salaries which remain after they have paid the cost of maintaining their equipment for carrying the mail. are led to believe that they are overpaid. A few rural carriers have been accused of making their trips in two or three hours at certain times of the year. but no mention is made of the hours spent in sorting and routing the mail before they start on their trips. or the time required to take care of their collections. or the time it takes to keep their equipment in shape for the next trip. Critics say that many rural carriers do not work eight hours per day. but they fail to state that only a few carriers are receiving eight hours pay. and they are the ones with extralong routes. By eight hours pay I mean the same wages as are paid to other postal employees. The rural carriers run a traveling post office and a freight truck combined. They deliver and collect all classes of mailC. 0. D.s. insured parcels. registers. money orders. and parcels weighing up to 70 pounds. The rural carrier is paid for the miles he travels and not the hours he works or the mail he handles. The Government allows him 4 cents per mile to pay the cost of maintaining his equipment. He makes 291 trips each year and receives $11.64 for each mile of his route. But this 4 cents pays only about half the actual cost of his upkeep. he must take from his basic salary at least $10 per year for each mile of his route to pay that part of the cost of maintaining his equipment which the 4 cents per mile fails to cover. Most rural carriers find that it costs them more than $10 a mile per year over the 4 cents allowance. but I take this as the lowest possible estimate. The de7 partment has acknowledged that he should be allowed one hour each day to take care of his equipment. whether it be motor or horse drawn. The rural carrier with the standard route of 24 miles receives $1.800 per year. But he must spend $10 per year for each mile of his route to pay that part of his upkeep which the 4 cents per mile fails to cover. This amounts to $240. Subtract this from his $1.800 and he has $1.560 as his net salary. He is being paid for only 5 hours and 56 minutes. including the hour allowed for caring for his equipment. When we speak of the time required to serve the rural route. we mean the average the year around. including the long days at Christmas and the auxiliary help which he pays out of his own pocket. Congress may be asked to consider a bill requiring the rural carrier to do extra work in the post office after he has served his route. In no case should this extra duty lengthen his days work beyond the time for which he draws pay. In other words. if he has a 24mile route he is being paid for working 5 hours and 56 minutes each day. and the extra duty should not require him to work longer. For each mile added to the standard route of 24 miles the rural carrier receives $30 per year. but he must use $10 of this money to help maintain his equipment. leaving $20 per year to add to his salary. So you see. in order for a rural carrier to receive a net salary of $2.100 he must have a mail route 51 miles long. Now. if there can be found a rural carrier serving a 51mile route who does not work eight hours. or a carrier on a shorter route who does not work all the time for which his route pays him. then there would be no objection to giving him extra work in the office to make up the time lacking. but those on routes having extra heavy mail or very bad roads. who are now working 8 or 10 hours per day. but receiving pay for only 5 or 6. should be paid for their overtime. Below is a table showing the basic salary for routes ranging from 24 to 51 miles long. the amount that must be deducted from this basic salary to pay that part of the upkeep which the 4 cents per mile fails to cover. the net salary remaining. and the extra time for which this net salary pays.
