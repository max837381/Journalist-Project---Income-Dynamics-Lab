660246669|No. that Is specifically provided for. in the Volstead Act.
660246670|I know. but the Constitution itself provides for a limitation for beverage purposes . Isnt that right. a prohibition?
660246671|"Yes. for beverage purposes. ""Mr. BnowN. But if you want to make effective your line of argument. and it became necessary. you would legislate that no liquor could be used for any purpose at all. would you not?"
660246672|"Well. I would say no. I have always advised against In any way interfering with the manufacture. sale. or use of wine for sacramental purposes. it has always been considered a part of the religious rite. They did It in one State contrary to our advice and the supreme court of that State held that they had no constitutional right to do it. It was Interfering with a religious rite."" The above Is from the official stenographic notes. This is in harmony with the consistent -attitude the AntiSaloon League of America has taken on this subject. We were asked at the time of the adopting of the amendment why the league did not urge a specific exemption for sacramental wine from the eighteenth amendment. The reason was clear. "" The eighteenth amendment prohibits the manufacture and sale of Intoxicating liquor for beverage uses. The Judiciary Committee and Congress considered the sacramental use of wine as having no reasonable relation to the beverage use. For this reason they decided it was unnecessary to specifically exempt it."" After the present draft of the eighteenth amendment was agreed upon by the prohibition forces. I submitted it to a large number of Influential Catholic lawyers to see if they had any doubt about the amendment and the construction for which we contended. Among them were Judge William H. De Lacy. first judge of the Juvenile Court in Washington. Charles F. Reddoch. a leading Catholic lawyer of Idaho. John Boyce. of Indiana. and many other leading Cathollb lawyers and laymen who gave strong opinions that sacramental wine could not be prohibited under authority to prohibit beverage liquors. In order that there might not be any doubt In the minds of Catholics concerning the attitude of the officers of the AntiSaloon League of America. this statement was adopted by the officers of the league. and given to the press. while this controversy was pending: "" It is the purpose of the AntiSaloon League of America to secure legislation to prohibit the beverageliquor traffic and not to ifiterfere with wine for sacramental use. ""This purpose was made clear by the national prohibition amendment. which prohibits only the beverage use of intoxicating liquors. This wording has been repeatedly construed by leading Catholics and Protestants as not including wines for sacramental use by any reasonable or fair construction. ""The AntiSaloon League forces In Arizona championed the amendment to the original prohibition law so as to specifically exempt from its prohibition wines for sacramental use. "" We wish to assert. without qualification. that It Is our unremitting purpose as AntiSaloon League officers. to avoid even the appearance of supporting any measure which would Interfere with the religious rites or ceremonies of any denomination or communion."" We trust that you will give the same publicity to the facts concerning this matter as was given to the other article."
660246673|Mr. Speaker. I ask unanimous consent to address the House for 10 minutes on the p9stal commission.
660246674|The gentleman from Minnesota asks unanimous consent to address the House for 10 minutes. Is there objection?
660246675|Reserving the right to object. on what subject?
660246676|On the postal commission.
660246677|I have no objection.
660246678|Is there objection? The Chair hears none.
660246679|Mr. Speaker. a parliamentary inquiry.
660246680|The gentleman will state it. -
660246681|Will the gentlemin yield back such timle as he did not use?
660246682|I will yield back tile remaining time.
660246683|Mr. Speaker. a parliamentary inquiry.
660246684|The gentleman will state it.
660246685|To whom did the gentleman yield back this tine?
660246686|pro temnpore. The gentleman yielded back the time. although It Nwas not necessary. yet. it did no harm. The gentleman yielded back to tie House itself.
660246687|"Mr. Speaker. I am sure that the idimhership of the House. like myself. have received a great many letters and clippings in criticism of the work of the Joint Commlission on Postal Salaries. and I think. therefore. that it would be appropriate for tie. as a member of that commission. to make a few remarks upon its work. One charge is that Republicans are holding up postal salary increases. In tihe first place. the commission was created by the last Congress. It. was organized on the 3d day of March. 1919. and consisted of five Senators and live Representatives. Of these five Senators there were three Democrats and two Republicans. and of the Representatives there were three Democrats and two Republicans. so that there were six Democrats and four Republicans on the commission. The Senator frobin Alabama. Mr. Banklicad. was elected chairman and the gentlemen from Tennessee [Mr. Moo] was elected vice chaimnan. That was the organization of the commission until March 8. 1920. when a Republican Senator. Senator Pniiws. was elected to succeed the late Senator Balkhead. The Democrats therefore controlled the commission up to that date. and they must bear tle I)lame if there was any unnecessary delay. Since March 8. .1920. the Republicans and Democrats have been a tie. so if nay blame there is for delay since then it should be equally divided. The critics of the commission seem to labor tinder a misapprehension as to what it was created for. They seem to go on tile theory that it was created for the sole purpose of raising postal salaries and to do it quickly. The statute creating it says it is "" authorized to investigate tle salarics of postmasters and employees of the Postal Service. with a view to reclassification and readjustment of such salaries upon an equitable basis."" There are more than 200.000 positions oil record in the Postal Service. and there are nearly 100.000 more employed under contracts or lunipsum appropriations. To reclassify and readjust all these positions of various classes and grades is a work of considerable magnitude. It is work that involves a reorganization of tle whole postal system. It is a work that requires much attention to details and a broad comprehension of the work of that department. It is a task coniparable to the work of reorganizing the Army of the United States. The Postal Commission. as soon as it entered upon its work. found that in order to obey the law which created It. it would require at least a year. and when the employees in the Postal Service complained that their salaries were not then sufficiently highA we took that matter up in Congress. The annual appropriation bill of last year carried the socalled temporary increases or bonuses. amounting to $200 or over. Congress then passed House joint resolution 151. which gave additional salary increases ranging from $100 to $200. so that clerks whose basic salary Is $1.200 now get $1.650. rural carriers whose basic salary is $1.200 now get $1.700. and so oil. These last increases were not recommended by the department. amd House joint resolution 151 became law without time signature of the President. That was done because it was evident the commission would require tile. It was. however. believed that a new salary scale could be recommended to Congress and enacted into law to take effect next fiscal year. beginning July 1. But the hearings were not completed until about two weeks ago. Since then we have hel executive sessions almost daily in which salary and classifications have been gone over and discussed pro and con. Many of them have already been tentatively passed upon. and the work is. I should say. twothirds finished. If we encounter no unforeseen difficulties. Ave ought to be able to make a report by the 1st of June. And if Congress is in session. there will be time to enact the recommendations of the conmlission into 1a1w by the beginning of the.next fiscal year."
660246688|The time of the gentleman has expired.
660246689|Mr. Speaker. I ask unanimious consent for five minutes. more.
660246690|The gentleman front Minnesota asks uaniinous consent to address the House for five lninutes.nlore. IS there objection? The Chair hears none.
660246691|"The idea never occurred to the conmilission that they were to start in and nuake a report before the evidence was closed. Now. if for aniy reason. either by the adjournment of Congress or any other. the recommendation of the commission can not be enacted into law by the first of the fiscal year. tile commission. I believe. would favor that whatever salary increases are recommended shoul be retro: active to tile beginning of the year. so that no employee would suffer any loss by reason of such delay. For these reasons it seems to me that this propaganda. if I may so call it. that is going on is entirely unjustifiable. It is alleged iii these reports that thecommission has "" fallen down "". thtt it has been brooding for 14 months over a report and is not able yet to make it. You might as well charge that ii court had been wastingits time because It ]lad been gathering evidence and considering it before rendering an opinion. So far as the personnel of the commission is concerned. I want to say this. that they are.. nearly all of them. old Members of their respective 1louses. and have bad a great deal to do with the postal work and. postal legislation. . They have approached their task with only one spirit. and that is one of kindly sympathy for all of the postal employees. I believe that every member is animated by a desire to do what. is fair and just by the employees. There has not been the least sign of any division oil party lines anlongst us. and we are all in favor of making a report as quickly as it is physically possible to do so and do it intelligently."
660246692|Will tlie gentleman yield for a question?
660246693|I hope that nobody will get the impression that we are going to report by the 1st of June. because we may not be able to do it. and I do not think we will be able to do it myself.
660246694|Well. I did not intend to fix any time. I was simply expressing a hope. The gentleman from Illinois is one of tle most hardworkig members of this commission. aid ie devotes mnore time to it. perhaps. than allyone else. and if lie says that its work can not probably be finished by the 1st of June. I will yield may judgnient to his. because there has been no one more ardent and efficient than he im the work of the commission.
660246695|Mr. Speaker. will the gentleman yield?
660246696|Certainly.
660246697|"I will say to the gentleman that I am a member of the commission. and I thouight last year that the conmission should have reported the 1st of December. and I think today that the commission should report before the 1st of June. and that a bill embodying its recommendations should be passed by the House beforethe 1st of June. ""1920."
660246698|WVell. I- should be yery glad tobe able to agree with the gentleman. and I shall strive in every way to make -a report in time for that work.
660246699|The time.of the gentleman from Minnesota has expired.
660246700|from tie Committee on Enrolled Bills. reported that they had examined and found truly enrolled bill of the following title. when the Speaker signed the same: H. R. 11927. An act to increase the efficiency..of the commissioned andenlisted personnel of the Army. Navy. Marine Corps. Coast Guard. Coast and Geodetic Survey. and Public Health Service..
660246701|Mr. Speaker..I ask unanimous consent to extend my rein aks in the RECORD on the soldiers bonus bill.
660246702|The gentleman from Montana asks unanimous consent to extend in the RECORD his remarks on the sol.diers bonus bill. Is there objection?
660246703|Mr. Speaker. I desire to call up tile Conference report on the bill H. H. 11960. the Diplomatic arid Consular approp riation bill. making appropriations for the Diplomatic and Consular Service for the fiscal year ending June 30. 1921.
660246704|The gentleman from Pennsylvania calls up the conference report on the Diplomatic and Consular appropriation bill. which the Clerk will. report by title.
660246705|Mr. Speaker. I ask unafinimus consent that the statement be read in lieu of the report.
660246706|The gentleman from Pennsylvania asks unanimous consent that the statement accompanying the report be read in lieu of the report. Is there objection?
660246707|I object. I raise a poitof order on the report.
660246708|The gentleman can raise a point of oider just as well and reserve it now.
660246709|Very.well. I reserve the pointof order.
660246710|The Chair will see to it that the gehtlemans rights are protected Without objection. the Clerk will read. the statement. 1 ..
660246711|Mr. Speaker. I ask unanimous consent to strike from the statement the paragraph at the head of page 5. .relating to the Mexican Boundary Commission. which was inserted inadvertently.
660246712|The gentleman from Pennsylvania asks unanimous consent that the paragraph referred to be stricken out. having been inserted bymistake. Is there objection?
660246713|Does the gentlemiin from New York mitke a point of order?
660246714|I make A point of order against the bill. and particularly against Senate amendment No. 15. on the ground that wheil the bill passed the House and Senate there was no provision similar to the language now contained in it. It is an elementary rule of the House that all that the conferees can do is to pass upon such legislation which is germane. and that they can not exceed their powers. Now. the Senate inserted ill Senate amendment 15 a proviso. reading as -follows:
660246715|Will the gentleman state what the section provided that is repealed?
660246716|That section provides that passports shall be issued to those who are declarants.- In other words. during the war. and for a long time before that. we issued passports to those who were not full citizens. but who had the right to go abroad. They attempt to repeal it by this act. and that is accomplished if this should become a law. In addition to that. in section 3 they practically make the consul on the other side the immigration officer to determine the question as to who shall be admitted to the United States. Furthermore. in contravention of treaty agreements. no alien will be able to leave here. It seems to me that the conferees certainly exceeded their powers.
660246717|Mr. Speaker. will the gentleman yield?
660246718|I do.
660246719|Was not section 8 an original Senate amendment?
660246720|Oh. no. it was not. Section 8 was added in conference. and sections 3 and 4 were added in conference. It seems to me clearly subject to a point of order on two grounds: One that these items are not germane to what was the original Senate amendment. and second. that the conferees have exceeded .their powers because there was no such amendment passed in the Senate at the time it was added on.
660246721|Mr. Speaker. will the gentleman yield?
660246722|I do.
660246723|Will the gentleman inform the House as to just what the provision was that the Senate put in with reference to passports?
660246724|The Senate simply provided that there should be a charge of $10. There was no provision by which the consular officer was to become the immigration officer. I will say that on a point of ordei in the House. when the gentleman from Texas. I believe. attempted to offer some amendment providing for an increased amount to be paid for passports. it was properly ruled out of order because that was new legislation. The bill went over to the Senate. and there they put in a proviso about the $10. That part was a subject for the conferees when the bill went to conference. but they could not go a step further and repeal the law or add to it a whole lot of new ideas. changes. and thoughts which entered their minds. practically nullifying the immigration law. That was and is exclusively within the domain of the Committee on Immigration and Naturalization.
660246725|Then the gentleman is not basing his objection on the point of order that as the Senate had put in $10 as a fee. the conferees exceeded their authority on that ground? He is basing it upon some other provision?
660246726|On the one proposition that the only question that the conferees could determine was whether they would agree to the $10 for the passport or the vis6. Personally I think it was a great mistake to put in the provision which they did put in that passports should be required for any person leaving the United States. Up to the time of the war anybody was at liberty to leave the United States with or without a passport. but under this provision which they put in here-
660246727|That was put in in the Senate.
660246728|Is it not a fact that that is new legislation. because they are trying to make permanent law out of the war legislation providing for passports?
660246729|Not only that. They have gone a step further. They have put in more drastic provisions than we had during the entire period of the war or in all of the countrys history. They strike at the very freedom of movement of the American citizen. although we are at peace.
660246730|If I understand the gentleman. lie makes his point of order against sections 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. and 8. and not against sections 1 and 2. Am I right in that?
660246731|My contention is that the point of order must lie against the whole conference report.
660246732|If any point of order is made. it is made against the whole conference report.
660246733|Yes. it must lie against the whole report. I have made my point of order to that effect.
660246734|Mr. Speaker. by way of analogy I should like to recall to the mind of the Chair the situation that is presented when one House strikes out all .of the bill as passed by the other House and substitutes a bill of its own. Of course. the rule is very well established and very familiar that when the bill goes to conference the conferees can throw away both bills if they like and write a new bill of their own. the only qualifiLIX- 44S cation upon that rule being that the new bill .must be germane to the subject matter of one or the other of the old bills.
660246735|Will the gentleman yield?
660246736|Let me proceed a little further. please.
660246737|I should like to correct the gentleman.
660246738|We all know that in many cases the second body to act in a case of that kind prefers to throw aside all that the first body has done. because it will find it more convenient to have its own bill throughout. The suggestion is often made that a further reason is that the future conferees desire to have their hands entirely unfettered when the bill goes to conference. Although the two bills as passed by the Senate and House respectively may be very similar in many respects. nevertheless the rule prevails and applies. the whole matter is in conference. and the conferees may write an entirely new bill. Take. for example. the case of the recent Army reorganization bill. The House bill and the Senate bill were similar in many respects and identical in some respects and in some sections. Yet. because the Senate struck from the House bill everything after the enacting clause. the conferees are at work on the whole problem. and will ultimately report a new bill for the consideration of the House and Senate. -Now. I ask the Speaker to compare the situation in that kind of a case with.the situation that is presented here. The House in its Diplomatic and Consular appropriation bill did not deal in any way whatever with the subject of passports. passport fees. the control of aliens coming to the United States. or of American citizens departing from the United States. The Senate took up the question de novo. although this was an appropriation bill. it inserted in the bill a rather elaborate amendment legislating anew upon the whole subject of passport control. both of outgoing and incoming travelers. When that bill went to conference. the Speaker will notice. there was a complete lack of agreement between the Senate and the House. The House had not spoken at aill. The Senate had spoken in tmns of this elaborate amendment. In other words. there was no point of accord between the two bodies. If. as I have suggested. the authority of the conferees is practically unlimited except with respect to the element of gerinaneness. where one House has passed a bill and the other House has passed at substituteoften very similarfor that bill. surely in this case. where there is no point of contact whatever between the Semiate and the House. the conferees. as they go into conference. must have at least an equally broad power as compared to that which they have in the other case. With that in mind I want to call the attention of the Chair to the form in which this matter passed the Senate. The first paragraph of the Senate amendment provided a system of. establishing and collecting passport fees for citizens. and if the Chair will particularly notice it included a provision for persons who have declared their intention to become citizens of the United States. The gentleman from New York lays great stress on the fact that section 8 of the conference report. as reported by the conferees. repeals the former law. Of course. almost all legislation is a change of the previous law.
