560070881|Reserving the right to object. I should like io hear an explanation of the bill.
560070882|I wish to inquire whether the bill provides for fishways over this dam?
560070883|This bill is designed to utilize a part of the Mississippi River that is not now used for any other purpose. It is at the lower rapids of the Mississippi opposite Keokuk.
560070884|On the Illinois side? Mno HEDGE. On the Illinois side. The gentlemans colleague. Colonel MARSH. who represents that district. is in entire accord with me and helped me to prepare this bill. This bill. or one very similar to it. was passed by the House in the Fiftythird Congress. This measure has received the approval of the Secretary of War and of the Chief Engineer of the Army. I can say from personal knowledge that the only purpose is to make what might he called a mill race. This dam will extend only oneeighth of the distance across the river. Navigation there. Mr. Speaker. is through the great Governmnent canal on the Iowa side of the river. the remaining portion of the Mississippi there not being navigable except in unusually high water. and is rarely used for navigation at any time. The object of this bill is therefore very plain.
560070885|Let me ask the gentleman a question-
560070886|Certainly.
560070887|How long has it been in that condition?
560070888|Always. There has been no change in that condition as far as we have been able to ascertain. And the proposition embodied in the pending bill is entirely acceptable to all parties interested. 1 will say.-
560070889|Will the gentleman allow me to ask him a question?
560070890|Certainly.
560070891|I would like to ask If the Secretary of War. or any other Government official who has cognizance of the matter. hasgiven his indorsement to this enterprise. It seems to be quite an unusual thing to allow an obstruction of this character. extendingsome 500 feet into the water of a great river.
560070892|I will say to the gentleman from Wisconsin that in the Fiftythird Congress the attention df the Secretary of War was brought to this matter. and I have at hand his communication upon the subject. At this point the river is about 4.000 feet wide.
560070893|What does the Secretary say in connection with the matter?
560070894|I will read to the gentleman what he does say:
560070895|OF THE COMMITTEE ON Coln iErF United States Senate. Then Gen. Thomas Lincoln Casey. the Chief of Engineers. in a long report also approved of this construction. and I may add in this connection that Major McKenzie. who had immediate jurisdiction of the improvement on the Upper Mississippi River. also indorsed it. The Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce approved unanimously of the proposition.
560070896|Is there objection to the request of the gentleman for the immediate consideration of this bill?
560070897|Mr. SDeaker.. in view of the fact that unanimous consent has been granted for the consideration of this bill. I should be glad to avail myself of the opportunity of inquiring of the gentleman from Iowa . for my own information. as to the status of telegraph and tolephone lines generally through the public lands. and by what authority such rights are granted?
560070898|If I am permittedto do so. I shall be very glad to answer my friend from Massachusetts.
560070899|The inquiry that I desired to submit to the gentleman from Iowa is not connected immediately With the pending bill. but I should like to ask him as to the provisions of law now existing in regard to the construction of these telegraph and telephone lines and the acquisition of rights for such purposes over the public lands and through the public parks and reservations belonging to the United States.
560070900|The question of the gentleman from Massachusetts does not refer to the pending bill?
560070901|of- Massachusetts. Not at all. but only with reference to the general policy pursued by the Committee on the Public Lands in the cases to which I have referred.
560070902|There is a bill. as the gentleman from Massachusetts is doubtless aware. now on the Calendar in regard to the rights of way for telegraph and telephone lines and irrigation ditches and other mdtters of that kind through the public lands.
560070903|I understand that. But what is thepresent law in reference to this matter? Does the law require. as was required in the case of the bill just now discussed by the House. that there shall be some supervision over this matter by some Government officialthe Secretary of the Interior. we will say. for instance?
560070904|I will state to the gentleman from Massachusetts that as to parks. reservations. etc.. each separate bill has to be taken up andconsidered by itself. and the Secretary of the Interior is presumed to take the matter under advisement. We had such a bill up a few moments ago and my distinguished friend from New York objected to it.
560070905|But the bill passed reserved the right to alter or repeal the grant. and also provided means to regulate charters. etc. Now. the bill to which the gentleman from Iowa refers has no such safeguard as far as I am able to understand. and I would like to know if. in his judgment. it has been carefully considered by the gentleman himself or by his 6ommittee.
560070906|We have carefully examined all bills referred to our committee. which have been reported to the House. We have granted rights of way to telegraph and telephone companies and for irrigation ditches over various reservations. but this is simply a general provision which does not apply to such bills.
560070907|Lef us have the regular order. Mr. Speaker.
560070908|The regular order is demanded. which is the question on the engrossment and third reading of the bill which has just been read. The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time. and it was accordingly read the third time. and passed. On motion of Mr. HEDGE. a motion to reconsider the vote last taken was laid on the table.
560070909|Mr. Speaker. I ask unanimous consent for the present consideration of the bill to provide for the establishment of the intersection of the true one hundredth meridian with Red River. to ascertain the amount of taxes collected by the State of Texas in what was formerly known as Greer County and the expenditures made on account of said county by said State. and for other purposes. The bill is on the Clerks desk. I want to state in advance that this bill has passed the Senate and has been unanimously reported with amendments by the Committee on the Judiciary of the House.
560070910|The Clerk will report the bill.
560070911|Is there objection?
560070912|I would not object to the bill if it simply provided for the establishment of a boundary line. not even on account of the long preamble. which I think might be improved by adding the Declaration of Independence and a few other things.
560070913|I am not responsible for the length of the preamble. It comes here in that shape. It is. however. fully explanatory of the object of the bill.
560070914|But there is a provision in this bill that looks to the establishment of a claim on the part of the State of Texas for having built schoolhouses on this disputed strip. in case it is found not to belong to the State of Texas. but to the territory of the United States. Now. I am not in favor of starting in on any such claim as that at this time. The courts of Texas would not allow it as between two of its citizens if one of them had occupied the territory of another and put betterments on it and afterwards he was ousted by a judgment of eviction. They would belong to the man who owned the land and not to the man who put the improvements on. and I do not believe that we ought even to allow the foundation for any such claim by a bill of this kind. And unless it is desired to change this bill so as simply to establish a boundary line. I shall object to its consideration.
560070915|Before my friend objects. I should like to say to him that I do not see any wisdom to an objection to a bill which simply seeks to settle amicably and in a friendly and just way a controversy between the Government of the United States and the State of Texas. Now. this does not recognize any such claim as the gentleman speaks of.
560070916|Why do you put the provision in the bill. then. to ascertain how much taxes the State of Texas or this county in Texas has collected from the people living in thig Territory. and how much it has cost for schoolhouses and things of that kind? Why do you put that in the bill if there is no foundation for any claim?
560070917|I should like to ask my friend another question. How did this bill get before the Judiciary Committee? This whole matter of the Greer County legislation that has gone through Congre%s has come from the Committee on the Public Lands on bills reported by that committee. up to this time.
560070918|Do you object to it on that ground?
560070919|No. but what is there in this bill that requires it to go to any other committee?
560070920|I do not know what there was about it that should require it to go there. excepting the rules of the House. which would not permit it to go anywhere else.
560070921|Is it intended to collect this money from Oklahoma. if any is fouLd to be due to the State of Texas?
560070922|No. we knew better than to try to collect any money from Oklahoma.
560070923|I was wondering where this bill came from. I never beard of if before.
560070924|May I state for the information of the gentleman from New York . and also the gentleman from Iowa . and the gentleman from Oklahoma . that this bill. as already indicated. came from the Senate. It was considered and unanimously reported by the Judiciary Committee of the Senate. and passed that body without objection. In the report submitted by the Judiciary Committee of the House there is a quotation of a statement made by the chairman: of the Judiciary Committee of the Senate which is fully explanatory of the nature of this bill and the necessity for its passage.
560070925|The whole controversy grows out of the title to the public lands known as Greer County. and the question is based wholly upon whether that land belonged to the United States or belonged to the State of Texas. The Supreme Court of the United States held by the United States?
560070926|This matter was referred to the Committee on Public Lands to prepare legislation uponit. Mr. Brown. of Texas. representing the settlers. and the Delegate from Oklahoma. representing the settlers there. also appeared before the committee. and legislation adjusting the whole matter of Greer County was passed through that committee. Now. this seems to require an investigation of the whole publicland question.
560070927|Oh. no. you do not.understand the situation.
560070928|I am trying to understand. and that is the reason why I make this inquiry.
560070929|The first bill relating to the title to Greer County went many years ago to the Judiciary Committee of the House of Representatives. and there was an elaborate report made upon it by Mr. Willets. I forget from what State he came. There was also. if I remember correctly. a subsequent report from the Judiciary Committee of the House on the same subjectmatter. It had been a subject of controversy for many years. There had been many attempts to settle the question. and finally an act was passed by Congress authorizing a suit by the AttorneyGeneral of the United States to be brought in the Supreme Court of the United States against the State of Texas to determine this question of the boundary. and whether Greer County was a part of Texas or of the United States. That suit was instituted. and the territory known as Greer County was held to be the property of the United States. The suit was adverse to the State of Texas. but under an honest. earnest claim of right the State exercised jurisdiction over that county for many years.
560070930|After the court held you had no right to?
560070931|Oh. no. this decision was rendered only a few years ago. We had organized it into a county in Texas. It was considered an integral part of that State. We had incurred expenses in the construction of schoolhouses and other matters. and I submit to the gentleman. as a lawyer. if. after having in good faith occupied it and exercised jurisdiction over it for so many years. improving it. building schoolhouses. maintaining a system of public education. and incurring many other expenses. believing. as we did. that the title was in the State of Texas. is there anything wrong. or can there be anything wrong. in submitting the investigation of the matter stated to one of the officers of this Government. the Secretary of the Interior. and conferring upon him the authbrity to ascertain what the facts are. what the expenses incurred were. and reporting thereon in detail? And. further. if finally. when it comes back to Congress (there is no determinate nor conclusive action now contemplated aside from the inquiry proposed by the bill). if the matter shall come back with the favorable recommendation of the Secretary of the Interior. if it shall be found by him that it is an honest and just claim on the part of Texas. why should not the United States pay it. and why should there not be a full ascertainment of all the facts. which is the only present purpose of this bill? This course is. in effect. suggested by the opinion of the Supreme Court.
560070932|Will the gentleman allow me right there?
560070933|Certainly.
560070934|Now. then. if all your arguments are correct. would it not be better to take this up. not under unanimous consent. so as to give the gentleman from Oklahoma an opportunity to present his case in the regular order?
560070935|There is nothing. I think. that the gentleman from Oklahoma can reasonably object to for one moment.
560070936|I just want to say this: The title to Greer County. under an act passed by the gentleman himself. was settled on March 10. 1896. when the Supreme Court held that it was the property of the United States. and. therefore. under the organic act of Oklahoma. it became a part of that Territory.
560070937|That is right. except that I was not the author of the bill providing for the suit in the Supreme Court.
560070938|Now. then. we passed legislation. as the chairman of the Committee on Public Lands has said. taking care of the property rights of those people. they then being in Oklahoma. I suppose now we have to wait and let an officer make an investigation of this matter. Everything is going along smoothly and without any trouble. To me it looks that this is raising a question of where a new boundary line shall be established. and will consequently excite in the minds of the people of that county a doubt whether at the termination of another trial they are going to remain in Oklahoma. where they are now. or going back to Texas.
560070939|The gentleman is mistaken. It is not a question as between the boundary line of Oklahoma ind Texas.
560070940|It is the boundary line of Greer County. •
560070941|The decision of the Supreme Court of the United States has settled the boundary line as between Oklahoma and Texas. There is still a necessity on the part of the Government to determine the true one hundredth meridian where it crosses the Red River. It is not a question between the United States and Oklahoma. but between the United States and the State of Texas.
560070942|Exactly. but it is Oklahoma that represents the United States.
560070943|No. no.
560070944|They are not trying to get anything away from you. and they could not if they tried.
560070945|The Territory of Oklahoma is not interested in this. and is not affected by it in the slightest degree whatever.
560070946|I do not want to interfere with anything that the gentleman from Texas wants. but I do not want to lose anything we have got in this. Under this act the Greer County line was established by the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States.
560070947|Now. in this bill it directs that a new line shall be run.
560070948|Not as between Oklahoma and Greer County or as between Greer County and Texas at all.
560070949|It is to determine where the one hundredth meridian crosses Red River by definite astronomical calculations.
560070950|This bill is recommended and deemed necessary by the Interior Department of this Government. after careful consideration. The publicland question is all settled and disposed of.
560070951|What evidence has the gentleman of the fact that the Interior Department is satisfied with it?
560070952|From the letter of the Secretary of the Interior.
560070953|Why did you not print it in the report?
560070954|Why do you not print everything in the report? I suppose if it was deemed necessary it might have been properly included.
560070955|Let me make a suggestion to the gentleman from New York. The Supreme Court fixed an imaginary line. and this is simply to determine where that imaginary line is on the face of the earth. and does not affect the title to Greer County at all.
560070956|Then what do the schoolhouses and the estimate of taxes have to do with it?
560070957|I do not know about that.
560070958|It is to fix authoritatively and scientifically where the one hundredth meridian crosses Red River. That point has never been definitely and satisfactorily established. It is for the interest of Oklahoma itself that it should be done. We raise no question as to the title of Oklahoma to Greer County. that has been finally and affirmatively settled by a decision of the Supreme Court. and this bill does not propose to reopen that issue. but to provide for ascertaining the facts of the case by the Interior Department. to determine astronomically. accurately. and finally where this meridian crosses the Red River. Then these other facts involving the claim of Texas against the Government are also to be investigated by the Secretary of the Interior. This is like ieferring an ordinary bill to the Court of Claims for theascertainment of facts. except that it goes to the Secretary of the Interior instead of to the court. and then the whole matter is to be reported back to Congress and passed upon by Congress after due consideration of all the merits.
560070959|If you have no claim. why refer it to anybody to find out what the facts are about schoolhouses and the amount of taxes and all that sort of thing? We had such a case here the other day when there was a bill coming in from one of the States to reimburse it because of an invasion during the war of the rebellion and the House very properly set down upon the claim rather than to open up a case to be adjudicated by our grandchildren. if they should ever happen to have a seat in Congress. as to how much should be paid. Why not have Congress say now that we do not owe Texas a dime?
560070960|How does Congress know that?
560070961|Why not mete out to Texas the same law that she metes out to her citizens where two citizens reside in close proximity. and one gets. over onto the plantation of the other in good faith and builds a building and puts improvements upon it?
560070962|Will you sayI ask you as a lawyerif. under a claim of title. John Doe has for years enjoyed possession of a certain tract of land and made valuable improvements thereon ingood faith and under an honest claim. and afterwards in a suit brought by Richard Roe for trespass to try title or action of ejectment. these valuable improvements can not and ought not to be taken into consideration in adjusting the rights of the parties?
560070963|Yes. in a case of ejectment he would have to walk out and leave his improvements there.
560070964|Let me state again just whatthis bill is: It is to fix where the one hundredth meridian crosses Red River and to ascertain these other facts mentioned and then simply report them back to Congress for further action in the premises.
560070965|Well. if you stop there with fixing the point where the one hundredth meridian crosses Red River. and appropriating $7.500. if that amount is necessary to find it outalthough it looks to me as if there is a good deal of astronomy in it. and that any department of the Government might find that out at a much less expensewhy not do it. and not come in here with a bill putting up for the future a claim by the State of Texas against the Government of the United States that our grandchildren will have to adjudicate?
560070966|This. I repeat. is simply a proposition to ascertain the facts. and I dare say the gentleman from New York will be in Congress when the report in detail comes back from the Secretary of the Interior. and he can then apply to it his legal knowledge and his splendid abilities.
560070967|Oh. no. I shall not be here then.
560070968|He will probably stay here until the end of the next century. but that will not be long enough.
560070969|Is there objection to the present consideration of the bill?
560070970|I shall have to object. Mr. Speaker.
560070971|Objection is made. Upon examining the seventh section of the bill just before the House the Chair observes that it contains an appropriation. An error was evidently made in referring the bill to the House Calendar. it should go to the Union Calendar. and the Chair will direct that it be placed there.
560070972|I ask unanimous consent for the present consideration of the bill for the relief of John C. Smith.
560070973|Is there objection to the present consideration of the bill?
560070974|I should like to hear some explanation of it.
560070975|This man. John C. Smith. settled on this land in 1855. One year afterwards the land was set aside as a military reservation. in 1872. however. it was relinquished as a military reservation. and in 1880 it was turned.over by the War Department to the Interior Department. This man has lived on the land ever since 1855 except the time when he was driven off by the Indians and a few months when he was driven off by the soldiers of the United States. But in each case. after being driven off. he went back. and he has been living there ever since. He has raised a family there and has put up improvements.
560070976|If the land was abandoned as a Government reservation. the man was entitled to enter it at $1.25 an acre.
560070977|The land was not included in any military reservation at the time he settled on it. This bill is recommended by the Commissioner of the General Land Office. and certainly presents a very equitable case.
560070978|I ask unanimous consent for the present consideration of the bill for the relief of Frank E. Kellogg. collector of the Sixth internalrevenue district of Missouri.
560070979|Is that the same bill we had up the other day?
560070980|Yes. sir. the same bill. I explained it then.
560070981|I ask unanimous consent for the present consideration of the bill which I send to the desk.
560070982|Is there objection?
560070983|Reserving the right to object. I should like to hear an explanation.
560070984|Mr. Speaker. this bl a up for consideration some two months ago. and its merits were. I think. fully presented at that time. Its further consideration was objected to by the gentleman from California . not that he bad any objection. as I understand. to the mneasure itself. but~he was opposed to the provisions of the lab of 1897. That law governing forest reservations requires that before sale may be made of grown timber or dead or down timber there must he advertisemert for sixty days in two newspapersone the nearest to the place of sale. and the other a newspaper at the seat of the government of the State or Territory in which the reservation is situated. Tlhe application for purchase must be submitted to the superintendent of the reservation. by him transmitted to the Secretary of the Interior. then returned and examination made. By reason of the sixty days advertisement and the other proceedings required. such a vast amount of time is consumed that the prospective purchaser frequently becomes discouraged and gives up the purchase. Tise is a matter of great importance to the people of the western part of my State. because about 30.000 peopl ae a more or less interested in this special reservation. without taking into consideration the interests of the State at large. which are all involved. This legislation was recommended by the Commissioner of the General Land Office in 1899. and his recommendation was indorsed and approved by the Secretary of the. Interior. It modifies and shortens the term which is provided in the old law to thirty days. The members of the House will ufiderstand. of course. that timber for various purposes is frequently required in small quantities on these reservations. and it would be an unnecessary and unusual hardship to require sales under such circumstances to be made under the existing law where. under the rules to be established by the Secretary. the small purchase of wood can be made without unreasonable delay.
560070985|The bill. as I understand it. then. does not allow additional power to the officials of the Department in regard to dead or fallen timber?
560070986|Not at all. It does not affect it in any way.
560070987|I would like to ask the gentleman from South Dakotaif he intends to offer the amendment which was suggested?
560070988|Yes. undoubtedly. I will state to the Speaker that the gentleman from California. who has heretofore objected. waives that objection. if an anlendment which I will submit is considered and which is satisfactory to the California delegation.
560070989|Is the amendment a general one. applying to all of the public lands?
560070990|It excepts California from the operation of this provision of law.
560070991|It seems to me that there must be an objection to a provision of that character. I do not know what effect the bill will have-
560070992|The effect is that there is no waste of the timber upon the publiclands-
560070993|I will simply content myself by calling the attention of gentlemen from States who are interested in this matter to the posiible effects of the bill.
560070994|The Chair hears no objection to the request for unanimous consent. and the pending question is on the amendmend of the gentleman from South Dakota. which has been read.
560070995|Before the question is submitted. Mr. Speaker. I would like to know why. if this amendment to this bill as a whole is good for California. it is notgood for the whole United States?
560070996|I will state. in response to the gentleman from New York. that the harm was done originally in the sundry civil bill. which was passed more than a year ago. and to which the pending bill refers. Conditions in the State of California are entirely different. as far as the forest reserves are concerned. from those of Washington. Oregon. and South Dakota. There is and has been a mistake. I think. in the legislation of Congress in this regard. It is impossible to adopt general legislation that will cover a territory so widely different in its interests as our Western territory. As a matter of fact. we have but little timber in California. We want legislation to protect what is remaining. This is essential for the purpose of retaining water derived from the rainy season for the purpose of fertilizing our lands. In Oregon and Washington and that region generally they have more timber than they know what to do with. I do not think that the people of Washington and Oregon. therefore. aie able to understand exactly the necessity and the conditions which prevail with us.
560070997|I would like to ask the gentleman in charge of this measure whether he thinks he represents the sentiment of that people especially?
560070998|I think so. I have examined the subject very carefully. and believe that I speak entirely in their interest.
560070999|It ought not to apply to California for the reasons I have stated. without going into details or detaining the House. But I have consulted all of my colleagues upon the floor here. and they quite agree with me that this legislation should not apply to the State of California. though we have no objection to it if it is not made to apply to that State.
560071000|Why should it apply to Oregon and Washington?
560071001|Well. I do not know. They do not object to it. that is all I know about it. We do object to the legislation applying to the State of California. but we can not attempt to look out for the interests of Oregon and Washington.
560071002|I will suggest that the Commissioner of the General Land Office requests this as general legislation. but the demand for it. so far as I know. has come chiefly from the Black Hills region.
560071003|Yes. because it is very thickly settled there-
560071004|But the Secretary of the Interior and the Commissioner of the Land Office have desired it ever since the amendment to the appropriation bill to which the gentleman from California refers.
560071005|Why not limit it to the section where they demand it?
560071006|There has been no objection to it except from California.
560071007|I do not think there will be any objection in Oregon and Washington. where they have to burn timber to get rid of it. 55~
560071008|They do not have to burn timber to get rid of it. but they are making the mistake of doing it.
560071009|The Commissioner is very anxious to have this pass.
560071010|The amendment of the gentleman from South Dakota is an amendment to the amendment. The question is upon agreeing to the amendment to the amendment.
560071011|Before the question is taken. I wish to say that I did not understand the bill as the gentleman from California appears to understand it. In answer to my question the gentleman from South Dakota said it did not enlarge the power of the Department to sell timber. but only to deal with advertising it.
560071012|With the procedure.
560071013|The original bill does not contemplate the denuding of any forest reserve. but only the sale of down and matured timber such as can be cut without injury to the forest. You can not maintain these large forest reserves full of matured timber falling every year without getting rid of it. In some of them it is not necessary. but in others it is absolutely necessary to get rid of the timber that gets ripe to make way for the young trees t9 come on. and at least to take care of the timber which falls and endangers the whole forest reserve by forest fires. So if this bill only deals with the advertisement. thirty days is time enough and is as good as sixty. The amendment to the amendment was agreed to.
