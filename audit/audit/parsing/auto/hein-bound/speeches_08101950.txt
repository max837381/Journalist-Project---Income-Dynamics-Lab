810295026|Mr. Speaker. by direction of the Committee on UnAmerican Activities. I submit a privileged report (Rept. No. 2848).
810295027|The Clerk will read the report.
810295028|Room 426. Bakewell Building. 417 Grant Street. Pittsburgh. Pa.: You are hereby directed to appear before the House Committee on UnAmerican Activities on May 25. 1949. 10:30 a. In.. instead of May 11. 1949. as previously directed.
810295029|Room 426. Bakewell Building. 417 Grant Street. Pittsburgh. Pa.: With reference to the subpena served upon you on March 24. 1949. and our telegram of May 2. 1949. calling for your appearance on May 25. 1949. you are advised that your ap.pearance before the Committee on UnAmerican Activities has been postponed until June 8. 1949. at 10:30 a. m.
810295030|"The chairman has designated me to preside over the subcommittees hearing this morning. ""Let the record show that this is a subcommittee appointed by the chairman. constituted of Mr. HARRISON. Mr. NIxoN. Mr. CASE. and JOHN MCWEENEY. who has been designated to preside."
810295031|I would like to call as the first witness Mr. Steve Nelson.
810295032|Will you rise and raise your right hand. You solemnly swear to tell the cornmittoe tle whole truth and nothing but the truth. so help you God?
810295033|I do.
810295034|Is Josef Fleischinger your uncle?
810295035|I will take the same stand on that question. Mr. Chairman. I refuse to answer that on the ground it may tend to incriminate me.
810295036|"Let me ask you this question. In what manner could the acknowledgement that Josef Fleischinger is your uncle tend to incriminate you? ""Mr. BLocH. I dont know what my rights are here. I know they are severely limited. they have been in the past. I dont know iT the committee would like to hear an objection in any legal form. If I am allowed to record the objections. I would like to state for the record that the question itself calls for the divulgence of information that might be incriminatory in character. Therefore. the question is improper and I object to it."
810295037|In reply to counsel. I desire to state that if there is any indication from evidence that is presented to this committee that such should be the case. he would be within his rights in claiming immunity.
810295038|Furnishing you evidence. or a scintilla of evidence. to indicate the basis of the witness refusal to answer on the ground it might tend to incriminate him would. in and of itself. destroy the privilege. because it might furnish a link. or a clue. or evidence itself. that might reveal information of an incriminatory character.
810295039|In the absence of or refusal of the witness to give any evidence to this committee wherein the divulgence of that information might be incriminating. I think he should be compelled to answer the question.
810295040|I wonder if the committee would give me a moment to discuss with the witness his constitutional rights and clarify in my own mind something?
810295041|"Yes. ""(Witness confers with his counsel.)"
810295042|If the committee pleases. the witness would like to clarify his refusal by a sketchy summary statement which will suggest. at any rate. to the committee his basis for refusing to answer without destroying the privilege.
810295043|Mr. Nelson. proceed.
810295044|In the first place. I understand the fifth amendment to mean that you have no right to press me to interpret or to give you my reasons for not answering the question. Secondly. this committee knows that I am a Communist. and if I should admit that I know certain people. those people would be subject persecution. and I will not cooperate with the committee on that score.
810295045|Mr. Chairman-
810295046|"And of course because it would incriminate me. ""Mr. N~xoN. Mr. Chairman. the reasons the witness has given do not bear on the matter of selfincrimination. The fact that it is going to embarass somebody else who happens to be a relative certainly does not bear on the question of selfincrimination. I think the understanding should be reached at the present time that if the witness is using selfincrimination simply to show his contempt for the committee. that the committee should take proper action."
810295047|"The witness did not confine his refusal to the fact it may involve other people in persecutions. as he termed it. but he also assigned the reason that he himself would be incriminated. I think the record bears that out very clearly. He might have many reasons for refusing to answer. but I submit that if one of those reasons involves his right against selfincrimination. he refusal should be upheld. ""Mr. HpAReisoN. Might I ask what counsel suggests?"
810295048|I would like the witness to comply with what I conceive the law to be in such matters. that if he has any reasons or can give this committee any information that could lead this committee to believe that his reply would be of an incriminatory nature. then he should not be required to answer the question. otherwise. he should be required to answer. And I want him to have every opportunity to present to this committee some information that would permit this committee to come to some conclusion. because I deem it to be the right and privilege of this committee to determine whether or not the question should be answered.
810295049|Mr. Chairman-
810295050|"If the committee pleases""Mr. McSwEENEY. Mr. Case."
810295051|Did the witness complete his statement? He started to say for the further reason that it would tend to incriminate himself. Did that complete your statement?
810295052|"If I might be heard for 2 seconds on this question. and I think it is a question of law more than anything else. the courts have held repeatedlyand this is within the last few years. and if you care for the citations I can give them to youthat when an avowed Communist is questioned about his associations. affiliations. and activities in connection with his Communist beliefs. he has the absolute right to rely upon the fifth amendment. because the Governmentincidentally. particularly this committeehas made claims about the Communist movement. charging them with engaging in activities of a criminial character. ""I dont have to enumerate for you the various statutes under which it has claimed that certain members of the Communist Party have committed crimes against the United States. It is apparent we have a crime by conspiracy. and when you ask a Communist if he knows somebody or has seen somebody or engaged in any activity with somebody. it might tend to put him in the legal noose. I might say. for prosecution by the United States. ""The admission of a relationship may be very damaging. The witness. within the recesses of his mind. knows what has happened in the past. and I dont believe anybody. under our Constitution. has a right to inquire into those thoughts of his which refresh his recollection as to certain incidents of the past. as to whether he has or has not been engaged in conduct that might be conceived as improper. ""I might say this: I dont want to waive any rights as to the bona fideness of the question or as to the materiality. I dont know what this committee Is after from this witness."
810295053|You have a right to consult with your client any time during the questioning. and advise your client.
810295054|Thank you.
810295055|What is counsels recommendation as to proceeding at this time?
810295056|I would suggest at this time that if there is no evidence satisfactory to the committee which would indicate anything of an incriminatory character in the answer. that the witness should be required to answer the question.
810295057|"I move the witness be directed to answer the question. ""Mr. NixoN. I second the motion."
810295058|"All those in favor of the motion as made and seconded will signify by saying ""aye"". those opposed. ""no."" ""(The motion was unanimously carried.)"
810295059|It is the concensus of the committee that you be directed to answer the question.
810295060|"Will the reporter read the question. ""(The pending question was read by the reporter. as follows:) ""Is Josef Fleischinger your uncle? ""(Witness confers with his counsel.)"
810295061|Josef Fleischinger was my uncle. He is dead.
810295062|Did he come to the United States?
810295063|When did he die?
810295064|In the last year.
810295065|"Mr. Nelson. did he have a son. Joseph Fleischinger. Jr.. a cousin of yours? ""(Witness confers with his counsel.)"
810295066|I refuse to answer that on the grounds that it will tend to incriminate me.
810295067|Let me repeat the question. I am not certain that it was understood. Is Josef Fleischinger. Jr.. a cousin of yours?
810295068|I gave you that answer and I stand on those grounds.
810295069|YOU mean you have answered the question?
810295070|Yes. I said I refused to answer it on the grounds it may tend to Incriminate me.
810295071|IS that your full statement?
810295072|That is my full statement.
810295073|Mr. Chairman. I move that the witness be instructed to answer the question.
810295074|"You acknowledged your relation to one person. We are asking your relation to another. ""(Witness confers with his counsel.)"
810295075|I understand the implications of what you are driving at. and I take the position that this committee is trying to compel me to testify against myself. and I refuse to do so on the grounds that the Con. stitution protects me.
810295076|Mr. Chairman. is he contending that he would be testifying against himself. or tending to incriminate himself. if he answers a question of fact as to whether a certain person is his cousin?
810295077|May I answer that?
810295078|YOU cant testify.
810295079|"I dont want to testify. I want to argue it as a proposition of law. that is all. ""Mr. McSwEENuY. You can consult with your client."
810295080|I would like to ask this question of Mr. Nelson: Do you know a person by the name of Josef Fleischinger. Jr.?
810295081|I have answered that question. sir. the way I think it ought to be answered.
810295082|You havent answered that question.
810295083|That is the same question.
810295084|I understand you refuse to answer the question?
810295085|I refuse to answer it on the grounds it may tend to incriminate me.
810295086|And that is the full answer you desire to make?
810295087|I assume that goes to both questions. The questions are interrelated.
810295088|"Mr. Chairman. I move the witness be directed to answer. ""Mr. NixoN. I second the motion. ""Mr. McSwEENEY. All those in favor of the motion as made and seconded will signify by saying Ayes. those opposed. No. ""(The motion was unanimously carried.) ""Mr. McSwEENEY. So ordered. The committee directs you to answer the question. ""(Witness confers with his counsel.)"
810295089|Mr. Chairman. I refuse to answer that question upon the further grounds that because of the fact I am a wellknown Communist it may tend to cause harm to this person that you are bringing forward here. and I refuse to do that. as well as the fact it is going to do harm to me. This committee is trying to do something it has no right to do.
810295090|You have no right to assume that.
810295091|Will you pardon me for 1 second while I confer with the witness?
810295092|"Yes. ""(Conference between the witness and his counsel.)"
810295093|While counsel is conferring with the witness .1 want to make a statement for the record again that the witness contention that the testimony he would give might be harmful to his relatives or to him has no standing before this committee. as the witness and his counsel both well know.
810295094|Mr. Chairman. I have made two points already of the reasons I am refusing to answer. The additional reason is that if I would answer your question whether I had relations with this person it would definitely tend to incriminate me. and therefore I refuse to do so. * * S S *
810295095|I hand you a photostatic copy of a passport. Will you identify that as the passport under which you traveled?
810295096|I would say it looks like the one. * S S * S
810295097|As a matter of fact. you entered the United States illegally under this passport. did you not?
810295098|I refuse to answer that.
810295099|On what ground?
810295100|Because it may tend to incriminate me.
810295101|"The offense. if one existed. is barred by the statute of limitations. this having occurred in 1920. and the fifth amendment does not. in my judgment. afford immunity where you cannot be prosecuted because of the alleged offense being barred by the statute of limitations. so I again ask you to answer the question. ""(Witness confers with his counsel.)"
810295102|What is the question again?
810295103|"Read the question. ""The question referred to was read. as follows: ""As a matter of fact. you entered the United States illegally under this passport. did you not?"
810295104|Mr. Chairman. I dont admit that I came into the United States illegally.
810295105|You admit this to be your passport?
810295106|That is right.
810295107|There appears on the last page of this passport the following certification:
810295108|I didnt fill that thing out. At the time I was 16 years old or so. and I cant say. Therefore I refuse to answer the question. It might tend to incriminate me if I answered I came in illegally. or perhaps if you put the interpretation on it that I prepared the thing.
810295109|"YOU were arrested for deportation. were you not. because of illegal entry? ""Mr. NsLsoN. That is right."
810295110|When was that?
810295111|I cant recall. I think it was in 1921.
810295112|Was that about June 22. 1922. you think?
810295113|I cant be sure about that date.
810295114|Was a hearing afforded you on October 17. 1922. in Philadelphia. as a result of which you were afforded an opportunity to legalize your residence in this country?
810295115|That is right. but I am not sure about the date.
810295116|And is it not also true that on the 14th of November 1922. the Secretary of State waived the passport requirements on behalf of yourself. your mother Mary. and your two sisters?
810295117|I dont know what the technical or legal procedure was. but my understanding was that the case was dropped. and that ended the matter so far as I know. * * * * *
810295118|"I hand you a photostatic copy of a portion of the issue of November 10. 1937. of the Daily Worker. The Daily Worker is an official publication of the Communist Party. is it not? ""(Witness confers with his counsel.) ""Mr. NELsoN. It is not an official organ of the Communist Party now."
810295119|In 1937 it was an official publication of that party. was it not?
810295120|I believe it was then.
810295121|"I hand you this article. entitled Steve Nelson an Exemplary Political Commissar in the International Brigade. by Joseph North. and ask you to examine it. ""(Witness examines document and confers with his counsel.)"
810295122|I didnt have a chance to read it carefully. It appears to be an article from the Daily Worker. but I cant say that all the facts are correct. because the story was cabled from Valencia. Spain. At that time I was in a hospital wounded. and I dont recall reading the story. that is. the article. as it appeared in the Daily Worker. because I wasnt here at the time.
810295123|You knew Joseph North in Spain. did you not?
810295124|Yes. I met him. He was a correspondent for the Daily Worker.
810295125|This article describes your activity to some extent in the International Brigade?
810295126|Yes. I gather that from glancing at it.
810295127|In the course of this article it is stated: The working people of the Soviet Union were passing through a bitter period and Steve joined the Friends of Soviet Russia. On the first anniversary of Lenins death. he joined the C. P. at the memorial meeting in Philadelphia. Is that correct?
810295128|That is what the story says. but the facts are not so.
