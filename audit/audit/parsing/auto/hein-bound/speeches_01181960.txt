860151751|"Mr. Speaker. under leave to extend my remarks in the RECORD. I include an article which appeared in the November 14. 1959. issue of the Saturday Evening Post. ""The Poland I Saw"" is a revealing. inside story of the tragic plight of the Polish people and bears out the harsh truth that. even though this country has achieved more freedom and independence than any of the other Iron Curtain countries. she is still very much under the yoke of Communist oppression."
860151752|"Mr. President. the November 1959 issue of the Monthly Review of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis contains an article. entitled ""Some Misconceptions in Public Understanding of Monetary Policy."" The article. which was written by Dr. Carl T. Arlt. director of research of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis and a former member of the staff of the Committee on Banking and Currency. is an excellent explanation of Federal Reserve objectives and controls. and also includes a clear examination of current criticisms of monetary policy. I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the Appendix of the RECORD."
