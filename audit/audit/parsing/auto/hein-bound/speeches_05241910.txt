610181143|Who holds the office now?
610181144|I do not know his name. but I understand that he was formerly a very popular newspaper man.
610181145|Mr. Chairman. we have seen statements in the newspapers which I think are correct. except perhaps as to the amount of the saving to be expected. as to the laundering of paper money. Have the Committee on Appropriations taken that matter into consideration in this appropriation bill?
610181146|We have not. for the reason that the process of restoring money by laundering it is not yet fully developed. It is in the experimental stage. I believe. however. that inside of a year we will be able by that process to very materially reduce the cost of producing our paper money. We were not justified at this time in acting upon the results of the experiments as far as they have gone.
610181147|It seemed to me that if it was true that a saving of $3.000.000 could be saved to the Government. it ought to be adopted.
610181148|It would save a considerable amount to the Government. because it is anticipated that it will increase the life of a bill about onehalf. If the gentleman. when he visits the Bureau of Engraving and Printing. will give the director of the bureau a paper dollar he will cut it in two for him. launder one half and paste it together. and he will see the contrast between the laundered portion of the bill and that portion which is not laundered. The process can be completed in a short time. I will say to the gentleman. however. that if he adopts that he wants to be careful to see that there is a sufficient amount of paste on the paper when it is put together. or he will be minus a dollar. I lost one half of mine.
610181149|I will state to the gentleman that I have seen just what the chairman of the committee states in reference to the cutting the bill in halves and one part of it being laundered. showing the effect. and it seemed to me it was a most excellent way of prolonging the life of old money that the Government now destroys. and if there was such saving as has been claimed in the newspapers of $3.000.000. I thought the Committee on Appropriations should consider it.
610181150|I have no doubt in the world but that that thing will be accomplished. but at the present time the process is in such an experimental state that we did not feel justified in reducing the appropriation for this purpose for the next fiscal year. If they work it out so that it is demonstrated to be satisfactory and successful. of course they will make the estimate for the next fiscal year in accordance with it.
610181151|May I ask if the director of the bureau has facilities for doing this work at this time?
610181152|He has not an equipment that would be necessary if he were to launder all the money that is now redeemed and destroyed. Of course. It would not be wise for him if he had the money to purchase it until they know that the process is going to be absolutely successful. Nobody would be warranted in equipping a plant for that purpose until their experiments had demonstrated the absolute utility of the process.
610181153|Mr. Chairman. In order that the Chair may have further practice in his newfangled style of counting. I make the point of no quorum.
610181154|I make the point. Mr. Chairman. that the point of no quorum is dilatory. it was made only a few minutes ago.
610181155|It seems to the Chair that as a quorum was present ten minutes ago. it is not necessary to count a quorum again.
610181156|Mr. Chairman. it has been more than ten minutes. and I am inclined to think that I am within the rules in making the point now. certainly more so than the Chair was a few minutes ago. when he took such a long time to count a quorum.
610181157|The Clerk will read.
610181158|Mr. Chairman. I make the point that there is not a quorum present.
610181159|And I make the point of order that the gentlemans point is dilatory. He is doing it simply to consume time. and not in good faith.
610181160|I want to say to the gentleman that I am doing it in the best of faith.
610181161|The Chair does not feel certain that the gentleman from Arkansas has a right to have the Chair count a quorum again at this time. but the Chair will count. It is manifest to everybody that it would not be in order to constantly make a point of no quorum and keep the Chair counting all the time. That would permit anyone to filibuster so that no business could ever be transacted.
610181162|The Chair can glance over the House and see that there is not a quorum pregent. We are entitled under the rules to have a quorum present at all stages of the progress of legislation in the House.
610181163|The Chair will count. [After counting.] Seventythree Members presentnot a quorumand the Clerk will call the roll.
610181164|"Under the rule the committee will rise and report to the House. Accordingly the committee rose. and Mr. DALZELL. Speaker pro tempore. having assumed the chair. Mr. MANN. Chairman of the Committee of the Whole House. reported that the House had been in Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the sundry civil appropriation bill and had found itself without a quorum. that thereupon the Chairman ordered the roll to be called in accordance with the provisions of the rules. and 133 Members answered ""present"" and the following Members failed to answer to their names: Aiken Fornes Kinkead.

610181165|The gentleman from Illinois. Chairman of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union. reports that that committee. finding itself without a quorum. the roll was called. and that there were disclosed present 133 Members. the names of the absentees being recorded on the Journal. The committee. under the rules of the House. will now resume its session. and the gentleman from Illinois will take the chair. Accordingly thl House resolved itself Into the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union. with Mr. MANN In the chair.
610181166|The Clerk will read.
610181167|Mr. Chairman. I offer the following amendment. which I send to the desk and ask to have read.
610181168|Mr. Chairman. the amendment that I have offered increases the appropriation for this item $40.200. The purpose of it is to increase the salaries of 335 Janitors in charge of public buildings. postoffice buildings. outside of Washington. $10 a month. Janitors in charge of postoffice buildings are paid at the rate of from $55 to $65 a month only. whereas the janitors doing like service in other buildings in the same communities are paid a much higher rate. It seems to me this is grossly inadequate. Just let me refer you to the salaries paid to janitors in my home city. I have but little information of conditions in other cities. but in my city of 35.000 people the public building is in charge of a janitor. a watchman. and a fireman. There is no engineer. The janitor has to take charge of the heating plant and of the entire equipment of the building. The janitor is on duty every day in the year. holidays and Sundays included. He has no vacation at the Governments expense. If he takes any vacation. it Is by an arrangement with the fireman. who does his work while he is on vacation for a few days. and when the fireman is away the Janitor does the firemans work in exchange. Now. the janitor in that city gets a salary of only $55 a month and works every day. practically nine hours a day-
610181169|If the gentleman from Wisconsin will permit. in what other occupation in his city could a janitor receive $55 a month and work eight hours a day?
610181170|The janitor in the high school In my city gets $75 a month. He does not have to do any work on Saturdays. Sundays. or holidays. and gets ten weeks vacation in the summer time. The assistant janitor in the high school gets $65 a month. The Janitor in the city hall gets $65 a mouth. and that Includes house rent. fuel. light. and water. because quarters are furnished for him in the city hall. Now. he Is paid $65 a month and all these things furnished. The salary of the janitor In the normal school in my city is $50 a month. and he gets house rent. fuel. light. and water free. and also no work on Saturdays. Sundays. or holidays. and ten weeks vacation in summer. He has no care of the heating plant. as there is an engineer in charge of that. Now. there is no other occupation in which men doing that service and having that responsibility get as low pay. They pay elevator men here in the city of Washington $55 a month. according to the hearings before the committee. and an elevator man has charge of only the running of the elevator. This janitor has charge of the entire building. the heating plant. plumbing. repair work. the storm windows. and. in short. of the entire equipment. He is responsible for the mail as much as clerks and carriers. He has to be just as honest. because he has free access to the mails. and on Sunday for a part of the day nt least he is there aloneno one else in the buildingwhere. if there was the slightest taint of dishonesty. he would have ample opportunity to rob the mails as much as a carrier or a clerk.
610181171|The time of the gentleman from Wisconsin has expired.
610181172|I would like to have two minutes more.
610181173|The gentleman from Wisconsin asks unanimous consent to proceed for two minutes. Is there objection? The Chair hears none.
610181174|Does he fire up the furnace?
610181175|"No. there is a fireman. but If there Is anything the matter with the boilers. he fixes them up. If there Is anything the matter with the doors or locks or hinges. he fixes them up. He keeps a kit of tools and does all that kind of work himself. Afore than that. Mr. Chairman. there is no equality of pay to janitors throughout the United States. There is some arrangement in the departmentI do not know what it isby which they will combine titles and then give an increase of salary. They will make the title ""janitorengineer."" or something like that. and give him more pay. when. in reality. he is doing no more work than this man does. This man Is janitor and he is the engineer. and the only engineer. of the building. Now. it seems to me that we ought to increase the salaries of these 335 men in the 335 buildings in the United States. They have no organization. They have not come here like the clerks and carriers. year after year. demanding increase of pay. I would like to have included in this the laborers and the firemen. but I realize it is not desired to increase appropriations. This is only. $40.200. but it will give $120 a year to each of 335 men who are working for altogether too low wages. I hope the amendment will be adopted."
610181176|Will the gentleman yield for a question? I just wanted to ask whether. if the appropriation were made. the Secretary of the Treasury would be obliged to increase the salaries provided for in the amendment.
610181177|"I know of no way to compel him. because I could not offer the amendment so it would be new legislation. as I do not want it to go out on a point of order. But I assume from his letter to me that the Treasurer would do it. I have the letter from the Secretary of the Treasury wherein he says: There are now In this service 2.863 employees. 335 of whom bear the title of "" janitor "" or are required to perform janitor work in connection with other duties. It would. therefore. require an additional appropriation of $40.200 to make an average increase of $10 per monthn the salaries of that class of employees. I take it If this appropriation Is increased by this amount It will be allotted to these janitors."
610181178|I think there is no amendment that could be offered to this bill which is more meritorious than this. but I have some doubt whether it would be acted upon if adopted.
610181179|The time of the gentleman from Wisconsin has expired.
610181180|The amount appropriated for this service for the current fiscal year is $1.902.000. The amount carried in this appropriation for the same service is $2.400.000. an Increase of a little over $500.000. The Committee on Appropriations has given for this service every dollar that the department has asked for.
610181181|Will the gentleman permit an inquiry?
610181182|Is it not a fact that all of that new appropriation is caused by the increase of the public buildings that have come into the service. and no part is carried for the increase of the salaries of these men?
610181183|Not all of it. But. Mr. Chairman. however much we may appropriate. the law does not fix the salaries to these employees. The amount appropriated is distributed throughout the service in the discretion of the Treasury Department. Now. I hardly think that Members of the House will feel justified in increasing this appropriation to the extent of $40.000 for the purpose of giving an increase of $10 a month to the janitor of the public building in the home of my friend from Wisconsin .
610181184|Will the gentleman permit?
610181185|When was the last increase of salaries to these employees?
610181186|There have been some increases from time to time in different buildings. As the gentleman from Wisconsin has said. these salaries are not uniform. But the salaries fixed by the department are fixed with reference to responsibility and with reference to the amount of work required. These janitors. of course. do not serve throughout the entire day. We who live in cities that have public buildings know more or less about the service of these men. They must clean up the building in the evening and they must clean up and open the building in the morning.
610181187|Will the gentleman permit a question right there?
610181188|Is it not true that the janitors over in the House Office Building get $60 a month?
610181189|I do not know. I can not answer the question.
610181190|I know they do. They get $60 a month. or $65.
610181191|I have no doubt that is true. but the janitor in the House Office Building may be living in California. and he pays his own expenses in coming here for the purpose of taking his position. and lives here in a city where the cost of living is more than in almost any other city in the United States.
610181192|Are these men under the civil service.
610181193|They are.
610181194|How is it. then. that the salary is controlled absolutely by the Secretary of the Treasury?
610181195|Because Congress has from the beginning. in appropriating money for the service in public buildings. made lumpsum appropriations for this service. There is no stated salary.
610181196|The janitors in the House Office Building are not under civil service.
610181197|No. they are subject to removal at any time by the commission in charge of the House Office Building. Now. in view of the fact. Mr. Chairman. that we have given or proposed to give all that the department has asked. and in doing that we have increased the appropriation over $5C0.000. I hardly think that this committee would be justified in adding $40.000 more. in order to give an increase of about $10 a month to the janitors under the departments.
610181198|With that half million dollars in operation. will it be sufficient to increase the salaries of these employees?
610181199|I can not say.
610181200|The time of the gentleman from Minnesota has expired.
610181201|We gave the estimate. and all they asked for.
610181202|I would like to ask the gentleman a question. and I ask that his time may be extended.
610181203|Is there objection? The Chair hears none.
610181204|I understood the gentleman to say that this employee would come from California-
610181205|He may come from California. We are speaking of the janitors in the Office Building.
610181206|Is he kept on the pay roll the whole year around?
610181207|Oh. no. they are there during the session of the House.
610181208|Are they kept at the Office Building all the year around?
610181209|No. they are not. The force Is reduced when Congress adjourns. The House Office Building is in charge of laborers. After Congress adjourns the laborers employed are under the jurisdiction of the Superintendent of the Capitol Building.
610181210|What number of the force is used when Congress is not in session?
610181211|I am unable to say.
610181212|Is any gentleman able to give that information?
610181213|The House Office commission.
610181214|In your own committee. I think gentlemen ought to have knowledge on that.
610181215|The gentleman from New York . in charge of the bill on that side of the House. is a member of the commission and ought to be able to furnish the information to the gentleman from Indiana.
610181216|Does not the gentleman remember that in one appropriation bill we have passed there is a specific appropriation for janitors to the committee rooms and to the House Office Building. at $60 a month?
610181217|There are janitors to committees and some of them are on the annual and some are not on the annual roll.
610181218|I am not talking about Janitors to committees. but janitors to the rooms in that building. I am talking about janitors.
610181219|We appropriate for janitors to committee rooms also $60 a month.
610181220|On the annual pay roll?
610181221|Some of them are and some of them are not.
610181222|They are as to committee rooms.
610181223|I think the gentleman is mistaken.
610181224|The gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized.
610181225|Mr. Chairman. I hope that this amendment will be adopted. I would rather. if possible at this time. provide new legislation in the bill. by which it would be practicable to increase the pay of janitors and custodians of public buildings. for I understand that they are not allowed the benefit of the limitation of the hours of a days work. and that their salaries are small. running from $600 or $700. However. I presume. as the gentleman intends to introduce this measure. that the increase will be applied more or less proportionately to that class of employees. the result of which will be to advance their wages. I hope that if it is adopted. that the gentleman who offered it will be allowed to offer a suitable amendment. without objection. that will make it mandatory upon the proper officers to effect the increase in wages. We have heard complaints in regard to the men employed in this service from their friends. that they have not had the Justice which they should have had. I understand that some of them are endeavoring to have hearings in the Court of Claims. and are trying to learn whether or not the benefits of the eighthour law really apply to them. It seems to me that this is the time that an opportunity is afforded to give them some measure of relief. and that it ought to be granted. Therefore I hope this amendment will be adopted.
610181226|The question is on agreeing to the amendment offered by the gentleman from Wisconsin.
610181227|Division. Mr. Chairman. The committee divided. and there wereayes 29. noes 35. So the amendment was rejected.
610181228|Mr. Chairman. I offer the following amendmeat.
610181229|The gentleman from Minnesota offers an amendment. which the Clerk will report.
610181230|That is a mere duplication. which we are striking out.
610181231|Mr. Chairman. I offer the following amendment.
610181232|The gentleman from Illinois offers an amendment. which the Clerk will report.
610181233|I reserve the point of order on that.
610181234|The gentleman from Minnesota reserves the point of order.
610181235|Mr. Chairman. In the original construction of this building it was provided that electric lights should be established on the exterior of the building. The pedestals on which the lights were to stand have been constructed. but the lights themselves have never been installed. I have had considerable correspondence with the Secretary of the Treasury about this matter. and I have two letters from him stating that he is in favor of the Installation of the lights. but that he is unable. with the funds in his possession. to install them. In a letter received from him today he states that if $5.000 can be set aside for this purpose. he will be glad to install the lights. There is no place anywhere In this country where lights are more needed than they are on this building. It covers an entire block. It Is dark and dangerous around the building. because the Government does not do its duty by having the building properly lighted. The collector of customs of the Chicago district. who is the custodian of the building. recomInends the installation of these lights. The postmaster of the city of Chicago urges the very great necessity for their erection. The people all around the neighborhood of the building have been clamoring for more than a year for these lights. Last autumn. in a conversation with the Supervising Architect of the Treasury. he promised me that the lights would be erected within thirty days. and when I went to see him at the expiration of that period he said that he had not sufficient funds with which to do the work. I then called upon the Secretary of the Treasury and upon his assistant in charge of public buildings. and they have both expressed a desire to have this work done. It is a small matter. it is an important one. it is outrageous that it has not been done before. and to say that $5.000 of this $1.550.000 shall not be used for this purpose is unwise. unjust. and impecunious. The amount of money provided for the erection of these lights is certainly infinitesimal compared with the amount of money that is being appropriated for other purposes less meritorious.
610181236|Mr. Chairman. I appreciate the factsstated by the gentleman from Illinois. but this amendment increases the limit of cost of the Chicago building. It is for the installation of a service that does not now exist and for which there is no authorization. If this should be done. then the demands which are made upon this House. and especially upon the Committee on Appropriations. for similar improvements in connection with public buildings of course could not be very successfully resisted. There are a great many Members of the House who have requested. and can not understand why Congress has not in the past followed the policy of improving and paving the streets around public buildings. courthouses. and postoffices. but that has never been the policy of Congress. and I do not think I can consistently refuse to consent to provisions of that kind being carried in this bill if I consent to the amendment of the gentleman from Illinois for an addition to the Chicago building. for which there Is no authorization at the present time. I must therefore insist on the point of order.
610181237|I should like to be heard on the point of order.
610181238|The Chair will hear the gentleman from Illinois on the point of order.
610181239|The original provision for this building. to which I seek to have this addition made. provided for the building complete and contemplated the erection of these lights. As an eyidence of that. pedestals upon which the lights are to stand have been erected and the wiring to the pedestals has been installed. It seems to me that. in view of the fundamental law authorizing the purchase of the ground and the construction of the building. the point of order made by the gentleman from Minnesota can not be sustained. It seems to me. further. Air. Chairman. that the gentleman is captious in his attempt to strike out this provision suggested by me on a point of order. There are many things in this bill which have no merit. and here is a small item which is the most meritorious of any item that will be in the bill. no matter how meritorious it may be. The territory surrounding this building is traversed by hundreds and thousands of people. It is not like a building built on a prairie. The Government owes a duty to the people who live in the great city from which it derives a large proportion of Its revenue. It is the duty of the Government. it seems to me. to complete the work which it has begun. and aside from that. going to the merits of the question. the Government owes to the people of the great city of Chicago a duty which only construction of these improvements can fulfill. The State of Illinois. in which this great city stands. pays more than 15 per cent of the revenue of the Government into the Treasury of the United States. and to ask for $5.000 to complete one of the greatest federal buildings within the jurisdiction of the Nation. and to have the chairman of the committee stand in his place and make a point of order against its insertion in the bill. is a matter so impecunious that it is unworthy of notice.
610181240|The Chair thinks the amendment is clearly subject to a point of order. and the Chair therefore sustains the point of order.
610181241|Mr. Chairman. I want to reserve a point of order in order to ask the chairman to explain the purpose of this provision.
610181242|I will say to the gentleman from Indiana that in explaining the same provision with respect to the Bureau of Engraving and Printing I called attention to some conditions that existed in the Treasury Department with reference to the furnishing of power to the pneumatictube companies that furnish that service to the Government. It is for the same identical reason that we have carried this provision here. applying the proceeds received from the pneumatic companies on account of the power furnished by the Government. The Comptroller of the Treasury has ruled that the receipts from the pneumatictube company must be paid into the Treasury to the credit of the general fund. and for that reason at the last session of Congress. at the request of the depaitment and at the request of the gentleman from Massachusetts . who was very much interested. we carried this same appropriation in the general deficiency appropriation bill.
610181243|I do not understand why you propose to take some appropriation out of the fuel. light. water for the buildings. and a part out of the pay of custodians and janitors to furnish steam for the operation of the pneumatictube service for the postal service.
610181244|The gentleman. I suppose. knows that we have a contract with certain pneumatictube companies to furuish pneumatictube service?
610181245|What companies are they?
610181246|Some company in BostonI do not rememnber the name--and one in New York. and I think one in St. Louis. Chicago has the same service. but I do not know what company furnishes it.
610181247|There are two companies that furnish service to five citiesBoston. New York. Philadelphia. St. Louis. and Chicagoand under the contract for that service the Government provides all the power that propels the cylinders through the pneumatic tube. and as the chairman has explained the necessity. because of the ruling of the comptroller. so as to make available the amount received from these companies for that character of service to be utilized for the use of the Government.
610181248|Can the gentleman explain where the economy is coming to the Government?
610181249|It is merely a question of bookkeeping. The committee could appropriate a larger amount and have the money lapse into the general fund of the Treasury without this provision.
610181250|The advantage to the Government is this: In all our large public buildings we have a power plant. Under the contract with the pneumatictube companies. the Government is required to furnish the power for the tube service and the companies are required to operate the service. In order to operate the service. the companies either have to utilize the power which the Government has in the building or use an independent power plant of their own in the government buildIng. if the Government would permit them to construct such a plant.
610181251|And you propose to let them use the power plant in the government building?
610181252|We control and operate the power plant in the government building. and we charge them so much for the power furnished.
610181253|How much do you charge them?
610181254|I do not know. I can not recall. It is a specific contract entered into.
610181255|How long do these contracts last?
610181256|The contracts run for a period of ten years. under special authorization of law.
610181257|Are these the same contracts that were before our committee?
610181258|These are the identical ones that we have considered this year and prior years.
610181259|There are only two pneumatictube companies in the United States?
610181260|I do not know how many companies there are.
610181261|I withdraw the point of order.
610181262|Mr. Chairman. I move to strike out the last word. Nobody seems to know how much or how little the Government gets back from the pneumatictube companies for the service rendered by the Government. The hearings before the Committee on Appropriations. page 169. show that the Government does furnish steam to operate the pneumatic tubes. but those in charge of the work claim that the Government does this because there is no room to install boilers to operate the compressedair plants owned by the pneumatictube companies. The Treasury Department claims that while it furnishes the steam. it charges the amount back to the tube company. but nowhere in the hearings does it appear what the amount charged or received is.
610181263|"On page 170 of the hearings. I will say to the gentleman from Illinois. Mr. Ludlow. the chief clerk of the Treasury Department. says that the Government receives $40.000 per annum for the operation of those tubes. """
610181264|And nobody knows whether that is the cost.
610181265|He says: There Is paid back to us by these companies something like $40.000 per annum for the operation of these tubes.
610181266|Mr. Ludlow also practically says that he is not sure of whether that is the cost or whether it is less or more. I am not using his language. but it seems to me there ought to be some one somewhere who should know whether the Government is being paid all it costs the Government to operate these pneumatic tubes. and it further seems to me that the Committee on Appropriations. in making this investigation. should have ascertained Just exactly how much money the Government spent in the performance of this work. and what it cost it to do the work. for which the money was spent. and whether the amount of money received from the tube companies was sufficient to reimburse the Government for the outlay. Nowhere in the hearing does that information appear. and before this appropriation is made-
610181267|If the gentleman from Illinois will permit. if he will read the statement on page 171. I think he will see that there is a very full and complete statement of the whole transaction. showing how much of the receipts is credited to the appropriation for fuel. lights. and water. and how much for pay of assistant custodians and Janitors.
610181268|But it does not tell how much of this is for power. it does not tell how much this power costs the Government. and it does not tell whether the Government spent $2 for every dollar it received. and I submit that that information should be in the possession of the membership of this House before it is called upon to act on a proposition of this magnitude. Mr. Chairman. I move to strike out the Item In the bill which provides for this appropriation. until we can get the information which we ought to have to enable us to act intelligently upon it.
610181269|The gentleman from Illinois offers an amendment. which the Clerk will report.
610181270|Mr. Chairman. I believe the gentleman from Illinois will not be particularly anxious to have that done. The committee endeavored to get the information which he has stated is desirable. It may not have been as successful in obtaining the information as. perhaps. it should have been. but after all the duty of obtaining that Information does not devolve upon the Committee on Appropriations so much as it does upon the Committee on Expenditures in the Treasury Department. The facts in connection with this matter are as follows: In the cities of Chicago. New York. the Borough of Brooklyn as a part of the city of New York. St. Louis. and In Boston there Is a pneumatictube service. I do not know the conditions in other cities. but I do know that in the postoffice in the city of New York and in the postoffice in Brooklyn there is no room in which it would be possible to install and operate an independent boiler and power plant to furnish the power to operate the pneumatic tubes. When the arrangements for the operation of this service were first made the Treasury Department fdrnished the power to operate the tubes by slightly Increasing the force necessary to operate the steam plants installed to furnish heat and power in the several buildings. and they charged the companies with the expense incident to this service. and the money was credited to the various appropriations out of which the service was paid. and was thus reimbursed to the Treasury Department. Of course it is not possible for the committee to obtain this accurate information. in view of the fact that it has been confessed here today that the business methods in all the departments under this administration are so antiquated that it is impossible to tell anything about the cost of any service. The attempt was made to remedy that situation and to provide funds to bring in experts. men uptodate In business methods. to enable this administration to install a system by which it would be possible to determine how much these particular services were costing the Government. but the gentleman from Illinois himself. and I am not criticising him for exercising his undoubted rights under the rules. made a point of order against the amendment. and so it is impossible. because of his action. to install those uptodate methods and. by installing a proper cost system. to obtain the very information about the lack of which he is now complaining.
610181271|Will the gentleman yield?
610181272|Yes. I yield.
610181273|The gentleman from Illinois made the point of order against the two amendments offered by the gentleman from Minnesota. because of his belief that there was already in the service of the Government a sufficient number of men on the pay rolls. drawing compensation. to furnish all the expert Information that may be needed as to the cost of every character of service that may be rendered by any department of the Government.
610181274|Well. I will go further than the gentleman from Illinois. Not only are there a sufficient number on the pay rolls. but. accepting the statement of the President himself. there are many more than are necessary to furnish the information. but under the manner in which these departments are conducted they are such a worthless and incompetent lot that it is necessary to get some other men who have some sense and some talent and some ability to ascertain the facts required.
610181275|Most of them are civilservice employees. are they not?
610181276|If they are not competent the civilservice law does not protect them. and in view of the statement of the President of the United States himself. reiterated here by the gentleman from Indiana. that $100.000.000 could be saved by the installation of proper methods and by bringing the business of the Government to an uptodate standard. I am astonished that the gentleman from Illinois should first prevent appropriations to get more intelligent. experienced. and competent men to put such systems into effect. and then complain because the committee can not get from an incompetent administration the information he says it should have.
610181277|Will the gentleman tell the House how he would have voted upon the amendments?
610181278|I did not hear the gentlemans statement.
610181279|Will the gentleman tell the House how he would have voted upon those amendments if they were not stricken out on the point of order?
610181280|During the temporary absence of the gentleman from Illinois. I said when I realized the purpose for which those amendments had been offered. and when I comprehended the enormity of the confession that this is such a worthless and incompetent administration. that I should be glad to appropriate every dollar asked if by any possibility somebody of intelligence. capacity. and efficiency could thus be injected into these overpadded pay rolls of the Government and-
610181281|The time of the gentleman from New York has expired.
610181282|I ask a few minutes more to dilate on the incompetency of this administration.
610181283|The gentleman from New York asks unanimous consent to proceed for two minutes. Is there objection? The Chair hears none.
610181284|Mr. Chairman. I simply call attention to this fact so that the gentleman from Illinois will realize how helpless the Committee on Appropriations is when it is attempting to obtain accurate information about the cost of the public service through officials who are confessedly. according to the statement of the head of the administration. so grossly incompetent. I do not believe It fair for the gentleman from Illinois to stop this pneumatic service. so important in the transmission of mails in the city of Chicago from this dimly lighted and extra hazardous section. where the city of Chicago refuses to put any lights. to the outlying sections. while in the city of New York. where the pneumatic service is necessary-
610181285|I wish to say to the gentleman from New York that he does not know what he is talking when he suggests that the city of Chicago refuses to put any lights in the outlying districts of the city. It is better lighted than New York City is. or Brooklyn. either.
610181286|That may be. but nobody from New York is coming and begging the Federal Government for a pitiable $5.000 to light the streets around a public building. XLV428
610181287|Neither is anyone coming from Chicago to beg the Government to light its streets. They want the Government to light its buildings.
610181288|Let me say to my friend from Chicago that he said it was a dangerous place because of lack of light. I wish to say that there is no place in the city of New York that is so dangerous at any time that a reputable citizen is not safe at any time of the day or night. The gentleman said this public building occupied a block. and It was dark all around it. and was very dangerous. It is dangerous to the public because of the incompetents who are engaged in the public service in that building. The lights are needed inside the building more than they are needed on the outside. I should be glad to turn the light in. Perhaps there would not be so many defalcations in the public service in that particular building in the city of Chicago if it were well lighted within as well as without.
610181289|Will the gentleman yield for a further question?
610181290|The time of the gentleman from New York has expired.
610181291|Mr. Chairman. I move to strike out the last two words. The gentleman from New York has made a feeble effort to call the brilliancy of New York streets to the attention of the House. and he says. whether they are light or dark. they are always safe. That is the first time I have ever heard of anyone having courage enough to say that New York wds safe. whether it was light or dark. No one but the gentleman from Brooklyn would make that statement.
610181292|Now. my friend was never in any danger In his many visits to the city of New York?
610181293|I wish to call the gentlemans attention to the fact that. although he finds fault with my action in raising a point of order against the two amendments offered by the gentleman from Minnesota to strike out these appropriations seeking to obtain information. the Committee on Appropriations carried $25.000. 1 think. for a similar purpose in the urgent deficiency bill. I wish to ask the gentleman from New York if that is true?
610181294|For that purpose In the Treasury Departmentin one department.
610181295|Then. I wish to ask the gentleman from New York and the gentleman from Minnesota if it is not a fact that they carry $100.000 or some .similar sum in the legislative. executive. and judicial appropriation bill for this purpose? And then they come in this great sundry civil bill and seek to appropriate $200.000 more for the purpose of obtaining information in order that economies may .be made.
610181296|If the gentleman from Illinois will pardon n. he has overstated that by 100 per cent. The appropriation is only $100.000.
610181297|I am citing $100.000 in one bill. $25.000 in another bill. and two amendments calling for $100.000 each.
610181298|That makes $325.000.
610181299|And I wish to call to the attention of the gentleman from Minnesota and the gentleman from New York-
610181300|To such statemelts as that of the gentlelnan from Texas no man can reply.
610181301|The fact that all the information which is needed to properly conduct the affairs of the Government in every department can be secured with the men now in the service of the Government.
610181302|The President said they were too in competent.
610181303|If the men who are In the service of the Government are not competent to discharge the duties devolv. ing upon them. they should be discharged.
610181304|The President has the power to do it.
610181305|And if they are discharged and new men are needed. who have expert knowledge and through whos expert knowledge we can obtain this information. I will favo the appropriation of the money to pay their salaries. But w have already enough men upon the pay roll to do every dol lars worth of work that is done and every dollars worth o work that is needed to be done. I am opposed unalterably nov and always to adding to the cost of the Government by the em ployment of men to tell the men who are already on the pa3 rolls what their duties are. No business house in this country that Is conducting a suc cessful business needs any expert knowledge from any outsid source to tell it how to introduce economic methods in th transaction of its business.
