510120400|The gentleman should confine himself to the question of privilege which he states.
510120401|I am trying to do so. Mr. Speaker. and if I did not think that the Speaker would probably hold that I had no question of privilege and no privileges here. I would proceed to discuss that without bringing in other matters.
510120402|The gentleman ought not to bring in other matters. He understands that that is not proper-
510120403|I understand that it is proper that I should confine myself to the question of privilege. but-
510120404|The Chair hopes that the gentleman will act up to his understanding.
510120405|But I had asked the Chair to let ma know-
510120406|The Chair has been listening to the gentlemans statement of his question of privilege. and whenever the gentleman is through the Chair will rule upon it.
510120407|Well. then. Mr. Speaker. without commenting upon the conduct of the Speaker. or upon my motives in calling attention to this matter. I desire now to direct the attention of the House to another provision of the Constitution. which gives to the House the right to compel the attendance of absent members. I read from section 5. of Article I of the Constitution. which provides thatEach House shall be the judge of the elections. returns. and qualifications of its own members. and a majority of each shall constitute a quorum to do business. but a s.naller number may adjourn from day to day. and may be authorized to compel the attendance of absent members in such manner and under such penalties as each House may provide. Now. Mr. Speaker. if there is anything in the rules by which you can go beyond compelling me. if I am an absentee. to come into this House. if there is anything in the Constitution by which you can fasten me up. and imprison me in this House. and say that I shall not leave it for any purpose whatever. I want to know in what provision of the Constitution or of the rules you find authority for issuing any such arbitrary. unprecedented. dictatorial. and usurpatory orderas that. And I should like to know. at this point. whether the Speaker did issue such an order. I would like the Chair to answer that question.
510120408|Has the gentleman finished his presentation of the question of privilege?
510120409|I have not completed it.
510120410|If he has. the Chair is ready to rule upon it.
510120411|I would like to know as to the question of fact. I do not want to punish the subordinate.
510120412|Whenever the gentleman is through. the Chair is ready to rule on the question of privilege.
510120413|"The gentleman is not through. Iconelude. then. Mr. Speaker. that the subordinate must be excusable. I say that the issuance of such an order as that is no more warranted than it would be if the Speaker should issue his order that the gentleman from Arkansas should be "" electrocuted"" by the Kemmier process recently adopted in the State of New York. And then. Mr. Speaker. there is another reason why I would like to have this matter settled. I would like to have it settled. not only for mv own benefit. but for the protection of the rights and privileges of members under the Constitution. not only in this Congress. but in all future Congresses. so that we may know to what extent the power of the Speakerof the House may be exercised. I will say. Mr. Speaker. that if such arbitrary methods as this are pursued in dealing with the Representatives of the people. the day will come when it will be necessary to understand whether or not the Speaker may have a member whom he dislikes executed on the floor of the House. Such arbitrary and illegal acts are the parents of revolution. I do not understand that this order was directed at me particularly. but that it was a general order. I refused to obey it because it was in violation of my rights as a Representative under the Constitution. and in violation of the rights and the dignity of this House. Now. Mr. Speaker. [ think that this question ought to be settled here. I believe that it was settled in a preceding Congress. In order that the ruling which may now be made on the point may be correct I wish to refer to something that was said in connection with an occurrence in a preceding Congressthe F6rtyeighth Congresswhen there was a Speaker presiding over this House who was known throughout the world wberever parliamentary law is known as one of its ablest expounders and one of the fairest men that ever presided over a oeliberative body. The question then arose upon the right of a Representative from Massachusetts. Mr. Long. who. when he attempted to enter the House. was under the same provision that I have recited denied admission to the floor of the House by a doorkeeper. Mr. Long came into the House and prestnted the question of privilege. and in discussing it he used language which. if the Speaker will permit. I will have the Clerk read."
510120414|Now. Mr. Speaker. I have stated the facts. I repeat that I was not an absentee. I had not been absent from the House. I was not brought in here under an order of the House. I was here answering to my name upon the rollcall. not leaving the House except -to go within the Capitol to attend to my business. and coming back here inside of five minutes from the time this incident occurred. I bring up this question not so much because I felt the personal indignity. for I understood that this doorkeeper was exercising what he believed to be legal authority. but because it involves the highest constitutional and personal rights of members of the House. I disputed that authority. and would have disputed it to any extent. regardless of who might have been executing or attempting to exercise it. I went out and performed my business and returned here. The Speaker of the House. in my opinion. if he has issued such an order as that (and I have not yet ascertained whether he did or not). did so in violation of law. in violation of the rules of the House. in violation of the Constitution. and in violation of the personal rights and privileges of members ot the House. And I hope when we get a ruling on the point of order we shall know whether or not there has been such an attempt at the exercise of arbitrary power by the Speaker ofthis House.
510120415|Will my friend allow me a question at this point? Do I understand that the gentleman. notwithstanding the obstruction by the doorkeeper. did pass out?
510120416|Certainly. but after violent hands had been laid on me by the doorkeeper in attempting to prevent me.
510120417|Force was not exercised by the officer to such an extent that the gentleman was prevented from going? Was the gentleman injured?
510120418|Oh. perhaps it was a case of neanus molliter imposit. The gentleman will understand-
510120419|I am asking the question in good faith.
510120420|"Oh. he did not do me any personal violence. If lie had I would have dealt with him as I would with the man who issued theorderit hehad attempted it. [Criesof ""Oh!"" ""Oh!""andderisive laughter on the Republican side.]"
510120421|The Chair is ready to rule upon the question.
510120422|Will my friend from Tennessee tell us where he keeps his graveyard?
510120423|I keep it where the gentleman from Illinois keeps hisburied under my tongue. Now. Mr. Speaker. there is another remark to which I wish to call attention. which was used by the Representative from Massachusetts in discussing this question. He said: The rules of the House are not valid unless they are authorized by the Constitution. Mly point is in regard to the first rule. which has been read. which says that every member shall be present and shall not absent himself without leave of the House. that no power is given by the Constitution to the House to so far abridge the personal liberty of a member that he can not go and come as he pleases. but If he goes and is absent then the power is given by the Constitution to the House to compel his attendance. Now. Mr. Speaker. I offer this resolution as a question of the highest privilege. The Speaker held the resolution in order as a privileged matter. and. on motion of Mr. WHITTHORNE. it was referred to the Judiciary Committee.
510120424|The Chair is ready to pass upon the question. and would like the attention of the House for a moment. The rights and privileges of all the members of the House. in the discharge of their fnctions. are sacred. and the House can undertake no higher duty than the conservation of all those rights and privileges intact. And even if the case arises under dubious circumstances it is proper for the House to pause und give suitable heed to any question which any member raises with regard to his rights and privileges as a member. It is for the House alone to determine what they are. In this case the gentleman from Tennessee has embodied his complaint. and the remedy therefor in the shape of a resolution for the House to pass upon. if it be a question of privilege. The Chair thinks that the question ought to be passed upon by the ttous. The rules of the House make provision for obtaining. and for the retention of. a quorum of its members in cases provided for under the rules. In order to accomplish that. the rules of the House require. whenever a call of the House is ordered. that the doors shall be closed. Such closing of the doors. in the opinion of the Chair. is to prevent any member from going out. It is done for the purpose of keeping such members as are already here. and retaining those who may be brought here after having been sent for by the orderof the House. But that is the opinion which the Chair entertains as an individual member of the House. The Speaker of the House has issued no order with regard to the matter. but in response to a question of the Doorkeeper. or one of his assistants. as to the meaning ot the rule. the Chair stated that to be his opinion. and the Doorkeeper has acted upon it apparently. subject always and of course to the decision of the House upon an examination. As this resolution raises the question of privilege directly. which may be disposed of by the House. the Chair rules that it is admissible. and is before the House for consideration.
510120425|Mr. Speaker-
510120426|Will my friend yield to me for a moment?
510120427|For a moment. How long does the gentleman *ant?
510120428|Ionly desire to make this suggestion. in view of the allegations made by my colleague. having not consulted withany person whatever. I believe. if this presents a breach of his privileges. as a member of this House. it presents also and equally a breach of the privileges of every member of the House. without regard to sides. I believe it involves a very grave question. and I therefore move to refer the re3olution to the Committee on the Judiciary of the House to make an inquiry and report upon it.
510120429|I think that is entirely proper. and I hope that unanimous consent will be given that that disposition be made of the matter.
510120430|I trust that my friend from Tennessee will yield to that suggestion.
510120431|I think the committee ought to have power to investigate as to the facts. There is no such power given in the resolution.
510120432|Is there objection to the suggestion of the gentleman from Tennessee that the resolution be referred to the Committee on the Judiciary?
510120433|With leave to report at any time.
510120434|Mr. Speaker. I rise to a question of order.
510120435|The gentleman will state it.
510120436|Mr. Speaker. on yesterday while the gentleman from Illinois. chairman of the Committee on Appropriations. was occupying the floor. he made this statement: I will place in the RECORD a statement of the special orders that were made in the Fiftieth Congress. and that have been made in this.
510120437|I reserve the point of order that this is not the proper time-
510120438|The gentleman need not reserve the poidit of order. If I am out of order the Chair will overrule me.
510120439|I have no objection to the gentleman making his statement in proper time. but at present we are working under a special order. which I hold excludes him.
510120440|If allowed. Mr. Speaker. I will proceed. I repeat. the gentleman from Illinois said he would place on record a statement showing the special orders made in the Fiftieth Congress by the House df Representatives. He then went on to say: Why. at one time. through a resolution reported by the Committee on Rules. yen made special orders covering sixteen days. Here they are. And then follows in the RECORD. without having read a line or a word of it. nearly or quite three columns of matter touching that sub. ject. in very fine printI am not printer enough to know what style o1 type it is-
510120441|Nonpareil.
510120442|Nonpareil. my friend from Illinois says. After which the gentleman proceeds to make some remarks. which I will not read. and was in the act of sitting down when the gentleman from Ohio rose and said: I ask to print in the RECORFD the number of Fridays consumed by special orders at the first session of the FiftiethCongress or taken away from the consideration of private bills. Then follows: Mr. RooEas. I object to any printing in. the RECORD either by the gentleman from Ohio or the gentleman from nlinois. After which I find the following:
510120443|"Too late. my friend. That I did not hear. and I do not know whether it took place or not. Whereupon Mr. MCKINLEY said: I ask that it be read in the time of the gentleman from Illinois [Mr. C""Nos]. Then. as will be seen by an examination of the RECORD. there follows a half column of the matter to which the gentleman from Ohio referred."
510120444|The gentleman has stated enough so that it seems to the Chair that this is not the proper time to bring it up. after the gentleman from Kansas has been recognized. At the proper time that question can be brought up.
510120445|Mr. Speaker. can I not move to correct the RECORD?
510120446|The Chair does not think the gentleman can do it after the gentleman from Kansas has been recognized under the order of the House. but at the proper time the Chair will entertain the motion.
510120447|Mr. Speaker. I desire to be heard a very brief time on that.
510120448|The Chair thinks under the order the House has just adopted. the gentleman from Kansas having been recognized. that the gentleman from Arkansas is not entitled to make the motion at this time.
510120449|The statement of the Chair indicates that opportunity will be given to the gentleman from Arkansas later to bring the question up.
510120450|There is no disposition to evade a hearing of it at the proper time.
510120451|I insist that by the practice of the House on this very day I have the right to raise this question at this time. This morning alter the Journal had been readwell. let us go back for a moment. On yesterday we took a vote upon the passage of the resolution for this special order. It was developed on the last vote thatthere was no quorum. and this morning when we met there was no quorum. We had a rollcall and procured a quorum. We then approved the Journal. We then had a unanimous consent recognized by the Speaker. asked by the gentleman from Ohio . and the bill presented by him was passed. and then thegentleman from Tennessee rose to a question of the highest privilege. Notwithstanding the Speaker had entertained the unanimous consent of the gentleman from Ohio. the gentleman from Tennessee was cut off. The special order was then adopted. The gentleman from Tennessee was then recognized. And now. Mr. Speaker. the practice. the uniform practice. after the reading of the Journal every morning. is the correction of the RECORD. This morning I am cut off from the right to correct the RECORD. And yet we can have a unanimous consent asked. as the Speaker says. for the passageofa bill. and the passageof thatbill. Now. ifthatistobe the way in which the business of the House is to be done. I simply desire that it shall go to the country. in this connection. that while the gentleman from Ohio can get recognition for a unanimous consent I am not allowed. practically at the same stage of proceeding. to rise for the purpose of even correcting the RECORD.
510120452|The gentleman from Kansas will proceed.
510120453|Mr. Speaker-
510120454|Mr. Speaker. I rise to a parliamentary inquiry. How long will this debate now continue on the Indian bill ?
510120455|This debate will continue two hours.
510120456|From this time 9
510120457|From this time.
510120458|I desire. Mir. Speaker. to arrange with those who are opposed to this bill as to a fair division of the time. Under the rule recently adopted there are two hours for general debate. and it there is any one upon the other side who desires recognition to control an hour of that time I am quite willing that he shall be recognized for that hour.
510120459|I will say to my friends that I myself desire very brieflyI think inside of ten minutesto say something about some of the Senate amendments by way of suggestion. inquiry. and possibly of criticism.
510120460|Mr. Speaker. I will yield fifteen minutes to the gentleman from Arkansas [M r. PEEL]. my colleague upon the committee.
510120461|Mr. Speaker. before the gentleman from Arkansas proceeds. I rise to a parliamentary inquiry.
510120462|The gentleman from Kansas has the floor.
510120463|He has yielded fifteen minutes to the gentleman from Arkansas . It is upon the rule. I desire to ask the Speakers construction of the rule that was adopted. as to whether any one in the House will have the right to ask for the reading of any of the amendments upon which a vote is to be taken. either before or after the debate.
510120464|Any member would have had the right before the debate began. The debate has begun.
510120465|That may have been a right. but it was wholly an illusory one. for there was no opportunity to proceed under it.
510120466|There was opportunity if gentlemen had not been engaged in other pursuits.
510120467|I was not engaged in any other pursuits.
510120468|No. the gentleman from Kentucky was not. but ths Chair makes the general observation that in the confusion of affairs the matter passed to debate.
510120469|"I accept the Speakers definition ""in the confusion of affairs."" but there was really no opportunity for anybody to have any of the amendments read."
510120470|In the consideration of questions of order and privilege. and so forth-
510120471|The result at all events is that the House does not have the opportunity to have the amendments read.
510120472|The amendments are already printed. so that the House sufers no deprivation.
510120473|Mr. Speaker. I would like to have a little better order before I proceed.
510120474|The House will please be in order. The House must be in order. Will gentlemen please resume their seats and cease conversation? Will the House please be in order? Will gentlemen in the aisles please take their seats?
510120475|ir. Speaker. it will be remembered that upon yesterday. after the resolution of the Committee on Rules. under which we are now proceeding. had been submitted. I asked unanimous consent to nonconcur in the Senate amendments to the Indian appropriation bill and ask for a conference. At that time I gave some few reasons why I pursued that course. I want to say now I desire it distinctly understood that by doing that I did not in any way intend to approve the ihethod or the theory upon which the rule proceeds. I believe that the bill should have been taken up in the ordinary way. I believe the chairman of the Committee on Indian Affairs should have been recognized to make a motion to go into Committee of the Whole and take up these amendments one by one. Had it not been for the peculiar condition of the Indian service I should have been willing to oppose the adoption of the resolution. I understand the objection made on this side of the House was altogether against the principle of the rule. and not particularly the rule itself. Gentlemen objected to having to be forced to nonconcur in all these amendments in gross without an opportunity to vote to concur or nonconcur upon each one. I recognize that to be the correct principleto require the House to vote upon each question as it is presented. But. Mr. Speaker. the Indian appropriation bill occupies a different relation to the public service from any other bill of this character we are called upon to pass. and the reasons given then. and the reasons contained in a letter which I hold in my hand. and which I shall ask to have read. given by the Commissioner of Indian Affairs to the Secretary of the Interior. are the real reasons why I pursued that course. and have supported the resolution in order to get the bill passed.
510120476|"Mr. Speaker""being myself a member of the Committee on Indian Affairs. having also been a member of the subcommittee who made up this bill. and knowing the situation of the Indian service. knowing it was much embarrassed. and that much loss would result in consequence of the delay. I was induced. as I stated. to take the course I did and the course that I have continued to pursue. Now. I desire. Mr. Speaker. to call the attention of the House to a few of the amendments and the main amendment that the Senate has placed upon this bill. Many of the amendments to the bill are simply formal and amount to really nothing. but the important items I will briefly allude to. The iargest item-$400.000is appropriated under the treaty of 1866 made with the Creek Nation of Indians. That same question has been reported by the Committee on Indian Affairs to the House in a separate bill. with the recommendation that it do pass. and that the money be appropriated. This money is due to the Indians. as I have said. under the treaty of 1866. and is bearing interest at the rate of 5 per cent. per annum. and $20.000 a year has been paid to the Indians eversince the treaty of 1866 was concluded."
510120477|What amendment is thatamendment 16?
510120478|I do not know the number. It is to pay the Creek Nation of Indians $400.000.
510120479|Does my friend favor that amendment?
510120480|I do. and I will give my reasons for it. We move to nonconcur in thatamendment because we want to see what reasons the Senate have for putting.it in. but still I favor it. It ison page 13. amendment No. 15. The reason I would. as an individual member of this House. favor the payment of the amount is this: The money is unquestionably theirs. it is not ours. In other words. I say that by the stipulation of the treatyof 1866 itis part of the money that is dde fbr the Oklahoma country. It is now lying in the Treasury of the United States. bearing 5 per cent. interest. to be paid by the Government annually. and it has been paidfor over twenty years without appropriation. They ask for this money. and I would grant it to them. because it would stop the interest on the part of the Government. and thereby save $20.000 a year.
510120481|If my friend will allow me right there. First. is there an estimate or recommendation from the President. the Secretary. or the Commissioner of Indian Affairs?
510120482|I will say in reply to the gentleman from Illinois that we have no estimate from the Secretary of the Treasury in reference to this item. but there is a recommendation from the Interior Department to our committee. recommending that this amount be appropriated and paid. they do not say whether in an appropriation bill or in a separate bill. A bill was prepared and I introduced the bill myself. The bill was before our committee. they reported it back as a separate measure. and it is now upon the Calendar.
510120483|Has that met the approval of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs and the Secretary of the Interior?
510120484|It did. They recommended its payment. because itis a plain provision of the treaty of 1866.
510120485|Is the letter contained in an executive document?
510120486|I think it is in print. I sent that bill up there myself for the consideration of the Commissioner.
510120487|I want to ask another question in good faith. because I would be glad to see what reasons there are for assigning a recommendation for this appropriation. Believing as I do that it is most vicious and extravagant. I would like to see the proof so that I could form my opinion of it.
510120488|I do not know how the gentleman can consider this to be vicious and extravagant when no officer on the part of the Government has ever denied the existence of this debt. Under the treaty of 1866 we have recognized it and have paid interest on it at 5 per cent. for twenty years. and that interest has been paid without an appropriation. but the Treasury Department held. when the counsel for the Creek Nation called upon them for the payment of the principal. that it would require an act of Congress to appropriate the money to pay it under the treaty. The reason given in the communication from the Secretary of the Interior. if I recollect right. was that there was no dispute that this was a just claim. that it was plainly provided for by the treaty. and that there was no reason why they should not have their money. We were paying interest upon it annually. and they seem to be in a condition to receive it. and therefore it was recommended that it be paid. The next item of magnitude is the one for the fulfillment of the treaty made with the Chippewa Indians of Minnesota. That item. I believe. amounts in the amendment to $350.00l0. I have not had time to examine the question. but only $220.000 of that sum is covered by the treaty. and I think there is $100.000 included in the item that is for something else. which I have not had time to investigate. I will say. however. that it I should be a member of the committee of conference I shall insist upon the Senate receding as far as that item is concerned. if what I understand to be the fact about it is true. But the $250.000 to carry out the treaty under which we acquired over 4. 000.0O0acresof land. in pursuance ofan act passed by the Filtieth Congress. it seems to me ought to be paid as a matter of course. and there is no good reason that I can see why it should not be paid. There is another item that I want to allude to. It is the item to disburse among the Miamis of the Indian Territory some $27.000. a trust fund that is held for them in the Treasury. We are paying interest upon that money every year. and they now ask that it be distributed among them. As in the case of the Creeks. we reported this measure in a separate bill. ant therefore. in making up the Indian appropriation bill. we did not think proper to put it in.
510120489|Upon that point I desire to ask the gentleman a question. This is a trust fund upon which annual interest is paid to these Indians. is it?
510120490|It is.
510120491|And the interest is used for their education and subsistence.
510120492|Not for their subsistence. because they are selfsupporting. It is used for the expenses of their tribal affairs and for their education.
510120493|And now it is proposed to take the principal of this trust fund and pay it to the Mianis per capita. as in the case of the Creeks.
510120494|In view of the fact that this bill is full of appfopriations for the support of Indians. with and without treaty stipulations. and in view of the chance of these Indians becoming. at some time. a charge upon the Government. does my friend from Arkansas think it is wise to take the principal of this trust fund and pay it over into the hands of these individual Indians?
510120495|"In this particular case I do not think that that is exactly what we ought to do. These are not blanket"" Indians. They are civilized. they cultivate their farms. they raise their crops as well as the citizens of Illinois or of Kansas. They have already taken their lands under allotment in severalty. and under the Oklahoma bill they can become citizens of that Territory and of the United States. The last Congress appropriated about the same amount. $25.000. to be distributed among them per capita. They are selfsupporting and have been as long as I have had knowledge of them. The Government has never given them a dollar of gratuity since I have been in Congress."
510120496|And yet I find no estimate for this.
510120497|No.
510120498|It is recommended by the Commissioner of Indian Affairs?
510120499|It is.
510120500|Has it been recommended by the Secretary of the Interior?
510120501|It is recommended. but I do not care whether it is recommended or not. The chairman of the Committee on Indian Affairs and myself are perfectly familiar with the matter. We know these Indians. and we know they are as capable of taking care of their share of this money as the gentleman from Illinois or myself. and they are entitled to it. It has been lying in the Treasury for years. and now they want it distributed and they have a right to receive it.
510120502|Does not my friend think it is due to the House. to the Committee on Indian Affairs. and to the country that recommendations made touching such matters as the distribution of this trust fund should appear in black and white. so that they can be referred to?
510120503|Mr. Speaker. my recollection isI am not sure about it because I did not expect to be asked that questionthat upon this particular item. like the Creek item. we had a report from the Commissioner of Indian Affairs and the Secretary of the Interior recommending this legislation. because we reported a bill which is now on the Calendar. providing for finishing the allotment of their lands and the disbursement of this trust fund. and looking to a complete winding up of their tribal affairs. [Here the hammer lell.]
510120504|Mr. Speaker. there will be time on this side. I suppose. and I suggest that the gentleman from Arkansas be allowed to proceed in that time.
510120505|The Chair would like to inquire whether any arrangement has been made with reference to division of time?
510120506|There has been none.
510120507|As the gentleman from Illinois desired to present some objections. I suggested to him that at the conclusion of the remarks of the gentleman from Arkansas he should have fifteen minutes. and should be recognized to control the other hour.
510120508|I have no desire to control the hour. but I would like to have fifteen minutes.
510120509|How much time does the gentleman from Missouri desire?
510120510|Ten minutes.
510120511|Then the gentleman from Illinois will be recognized now for fifteen minutes.
510120512|The hour in opposition to be controlled on this side of the House?
510120513|The Chair will recognize gentlemen on that side.
510120514|Mr. Speaker. in my time I would he glad to ask the gentleman from Arkansas another question. As to the appropriation of $400.000 to pay over to the Creeks and the Miamis these trust funds. is my friend informed whether any portion of this money. and. if so. what portion. is to be paid to attorneys or agents for presenting this matter to Congress?
510120515|I will answer the gentleman. As to the Creek matter. I am certain there is not a cent to go. directly or indirectly. to anybody but the Indians themselves. at least. if there is. I have never heard of it. The Miamis have attorneys employed. but whether the agreement with them applies to this money. whether it applies to the allotment of lands. I am not advised. I wish to say. however. that we have nothing to do with that matter. If the contracts are approved by the Department. that is a matter for them. and not for us. The Senate put on this provision for disbursing the money per capita. that is all there is in it. We can concur or nonconcur. as we see proper. I say. let this money be turned over. Whenever an Indian tribe is sufficiently advanced in civilization to receive its land in individual allotments and to control its own affairs. I say give the Indians the control of their own affairs. and let that much of the Indian service be taken from the shoulders of the Government.
510120516|I will refer to that matter again in a moment. but in the first place I wish to call attention to another matter. This Inflian bill as passed by the Senate appropriates $7.283.292.76. being an increase of $1.260.654.01 over the bill as passed by the House. The average totaland I ask attention to thisthe average total of appropriations in the Indian bills for the eight fiscal years 1881 to 188. inclusive. is $5.278.000. or $2.000.000 less than the amount of this bill as passed by the Senate.
510120517|Does not the sum total of the bill of last year include the Choctaw claim. amounting to between two and a half and three million dollars?
510120518|I am coming to that in a moment. But I first call attention to the average of these bills from 1881 to 1888. Five and a quarter million of dollars in round numbers was the average amount that they carried for eight years. Now. for 1889 the Indian appropriation bill was unduly swollen by an appropriation of $2.858.000 to pay the Choctaw judgment. If that item had been omitted the act would have appropriated only. in round numbers. $5.404.000. or $1.878.000 less than the pending bill as it comes from the Senate. Now. for the year 1890. the Indian appropriation act was again unduly swollen by two unusual items: First. a payment to the Pottawatomie Indians of an old award. with interest for twenty years. amounting to $361.000. and a payment of $1.912.000 to the Seminole Indians for certain lands. If these two items had been omitted. the act of last year would have appropriated only $5.802.000. or $1.463 000 less than the pending bill.
510120519|I would like to ask the gentleman whether there are any items in the bill under consideration which might be considered extraordinary. that is. items which could be put upon a par with the Choctaw claim as swelling this bill unduly.
510120520|I will say to my friend that there is an item to which I will refer in a moment. an item of $400.000 to be paid to the Creeks. a part oftheirtrust lund. which swells the bill that much. But I want to say that it is no answer to the House or the country to say that the Indian appropriation bill as proposed by this House is less than it was last year or the year before last. because there having been an appropriation last year of the extraordinary item of nearly $3.000.000 to pay the Choctaw judgments. the bill for the present year ought to have fallen that amount. unless there were other extraordinary items. It seems to me that we are liable to forget what is a proper line of appropriation if we listen to the specious claim that this bill is less than the bill of one or two years ago. Having said that much. I want to speakabout this appropriation for the Creeks. There are over one hundred amendments coming to us from the Senate. many of them formal. some of them material. I do not believe that the House ought to agree to this proposition to pay $400.000 to the Creek Indians per capita from their trust fund. I do not believe such a payment is for the interest of the Creek Indians on the one hand or the Government on the other. If gentlemen wll turn to page 13 of the bill they will observe that the House appropriates 5 per cent. intereston this amount of $400.000. and $275.000 additional. Now. the Senate lets that stand and puts on an amendment proposing to pay from this trust fund--
510120521|"If the gentleman will allow me a moment. perhaps I can give him some light on this matter of the $275.000 interest. It must be remembered that the Creeks have $""2.000.000 in the United States Treasury. which went there as the proceeds of the purchase of the Oklahoma country. and this is the interest upon that."
510120522|Oh. no. let me read from the bill: For interest on 675.168. at the rate of 5 per cent. per annum. to be expended under the direction of the Secretary of the Interior. under provisions of third article of treaty of June 14. 1866. $33.758.40. in all. E69.968.40. This is not interest on account of money due for the purchase of lauds. but it arises under the third article of the treaty of June 14. 1866. The Senate lets that stand and then turns round and appropriates by way of amendment $400.000 to the Creeeks out of their trust fund. under the same third article.
510120523|Is not this interest due?
510120524|No. I think it is not due.
510120525|The gentleman will allow me to correct him. The interest is due this year and had to be appropriated for. as a matter of course. The House made that appropriation.
510120526|I do not understand the facts as the gentleman from Arkansas does. I merely call attention to the matter that at any rate it may be inquired about and care be taken that we do not make a double payment. Now. one further word. I hold in my hand the treaty of 1866. Let me read a portion of the third article: Four hundred thousand dollars shall be paid per capita in money to said Creek Nation. unless otherwise directed by the President of the United States. under the direction of the Secretary of the Interior. as the same may accrue from the sale of lands to other Indians. * * * The United States agree to pay to said Indians. in such manner and for such purposes as the Secretary of the Interior may direct. interest at the rate of 5 per cent. per annum from the date of the ratification of this treaty on the amount hereinbefore agreed upon. etc. So you see in the language of the third article of the treaty that the sale of the lands by the Creeks to other Indians must be made. and the $400.000 must come in and be paid per capita to them unless the President thinks otherwise. That is just what the President has directed. and this $400.000 goes into a trust fund and 5 per cent. is paid upon it for the education. perhaps the support. of the Creek Indians. Here is the proposition. though. without any written recommendation from the President. who has the power to make this reservation and did make it. It is proposed to appropriate and pay this sum per capita to the Creeks. I do not understand that it is necessary to do it for the preservation of the Indians from starvation or want. It is said that they are civilized. Well. they live down there and they are rich in lands. some of them. a few may be rich in cattle and horses. but a great many. I know from having been down there. are not rich in either. They have. however. I presume. enough to live upon. There is no danger of starvation this year. They have started some schools and the Government has started some. and the Government has an agent and agency there under the treaty stipulations. We are still expending money for their support. and with the Creeks and Miamis. in my opinion. it is a mistake. akin to the most reckless extravagance. to appropriatethis money. the principal of the trust fund. and pay it out per capita to them. If they should not have a sufficient fund for educational purposes or to support them in the event of famine or of great suffering from crop failure. then we will be called upon to appropriate again as a gift. The Indian question is not yet settled either as to the Creeks. the Miamis. or any other Indians. There is a public sentimentI will not stop to discuss it nowwhich justifies gentlemen in Congress in voting liberal appropriations for the education and support of the Indians. But it is a wise policy to keep for the Indians their trust funds intact and let the interest be paid to them annually. Now. the Senate put on this amendment. and I want to ask the House conferees and the Committee on Indian Affairs to go slow in this matter. and not only to nonconcur formally in the amendments. but to insist on the nonconcurrence. For I have an impression that if you will go to the bottom of this matter you will find that many people. I do not say improperly. are interested. people all along the borders of the Indian Territory. people in the Indian Territory other than the Indians themselves. possibly delegates or representatives of the Territory may be interested in these proceedings. and that it is not in the interest of the Indians themselves. and I have an impression that it ought not to be upon this bill.
510120527|Will the gentleman yield for a question?
510120528|Certainly.
510120529|Do you think it good economy to keep the trust funds of the Indians. when. as a matter of fact. they are as intelligent as anybody. when they are able to dispose of them for themselves. perfectly competent to take charge of their own affairs. and yet that the Government shall withhold this fund from them and pay interest upon it ?
510120530|I believe it is good economy to hold these trust funds intact for the Creeks and all other Indians who are interested in them for their education. and. if necessary. for their support. and that it would be good economy. in the nature of things. to hold the fund intact and use the interest for the education. perhaps the civilization. of the Indians.
510120531|Then. another question. When would you pay the principal?
510120532|I would not pay it until in the fullness of time the Creeks and other Indians had taken on the burdens of citizenship. until we had discharged our Indian agents. until they had become adapted in fact. as it is hoped they may be in theory. to the body politic. But there are trust funds which from time to time have been dissipated. like the trust fund of.the Cherokeesor rather. by way of example. the Cherokees of North Carolina. Perhaps these are the most intelligent Indians on the face of the continent. Now. the principal of their trust fund for education has been largely spent. Gradually the principal. year after year. has been trenched upon fbr the payment of attorneys fee and contracts made with them. until it is now almost exhausted. and on this very bill is an increasing appropriation from year to year for the education of the children of the Eastern Cherokees in North Carolina without any treaty stipulation whatever. And the Eastern Cherokees of North Carolina are citizens of that State and have been for many years. are voters and are as far ahead of the Creek Indians as day is ahead of night. Yet I say again. with their trust fund dissipated. the Government of the United States on this very bill. year by year. makes gifts and appropriations for the education of their children. It is not. in my opinion. good policy. and if I can help it by my vote this provision which takes the trust funds in these cases and distributes them per capita will not pass.
510120533|I suggest that the remaining hour be controlled by the gentleman on the other side of the House .
510120534|iS. We ought to have an hour for ourselves.
510120535|I yielded fifteen minutes of my time to the gentleman from Arkansas . and the gentleman from Illinois has taken fifteen minutes from the other hour. so that it gives us the same time remaining on each side.
510120536|pro tenmpore . The Chair does not understand from which side the time occupied by the gentleman from lllinois is to be taken.
510120537|I would suggest that I was recognized and yielded fifteen minutes to the gentleman from Arkansas out of the first hour. and the gentleman from Illinois got recognized for filteen minutes in the second hour. My suggestion is that each side has the same amount of time remaining.
510120538|Very well. I am willing to keep company with the gentleman from Illinois on this occasion.
510120539|There are fortyfive minutes remaining on each side now.
510120540|I yield five minutes to the gentleman from Texas .
510120541|Ir. Chairman. I would like to have the attention of the gentleman from Illinois with reference to one item. I desire to call his attention to the seventythird amendment. on page 56. The amendment is as follows: (73) To enable the AttorneyGeneral to employ a special attorney for the Mission Indians of Southern California. upon the recommendation of the Secretary of the Interior. t2.500. If I am not very much mistaken. an estimate covering this very same appropriation has been sent repeatedly to the Committee on Appropriations. I am not certain about it. but it is my recollection that such is the case. and I would like to be informed by the gentleman from Illinois if he has any information on the subject.
510120542|I will say to my friend that I think it is entirely probable that he is quite right. I think amendments 73 and 74 belong in the sundry civil bill under the Department of Justice. if they ought to be made at all. but they were of so slight importance in comparison with the other matters I referred to. that I did not call attention to them in my filteen minutes. but I am glad that my friend has done so.
510120543|My friend must remember that it is through j ustsuch appropriations as are contained in the seventythird and seventyfourth amendments that the jurisdiction of the Committee on Indian Affairs bas trenched upon that of the Committee on Appropriations. as in the cace of the payment of the Choctaw claim in the last Congress. It should have been allowed to remain with the Committee on Appropriations and reported on one of their bills.
510120544|I will say to my friend that I think he is quite right about that matter. but I did not intend in my fifteen minutes to bring up any question of this kind and have it mixed up in the matter. because it seemed to me that $400. 000 to the Creeks is so objectionable that I desired particularly to call attention of the House to that.
510120545|Now. Mr. Chairman. I will invite the attention of the committee. and especially that of my friend from Aikansas . to some amendments contained on page 50 of the bill.
510120546|pro temnpore. The Chair will say that the gentleman from Texas has two minutes remaining.
510120547|The gentleman from Missouri will give me two minutes more. I think.
510120548|I notice that the Senate increases the number of privates for the Indian service from 700 to 750 and the number of officers from 70 to 75. and proposes to pay these officers at the rate of $15 per month each. Will the gentleman from Arkansas inform me how much these officers are now getting?
510120549|Twelve dollars a month.
510120550|And this increaqes the pay of seventyfive officers $3 a month.
510120551|That is correct. I think.
510120552|On page 57 I notice another amendment by which it is proposed to erect a school building at the Blackfeet agency.to cost not exceeding $25.000. It occurs to me. Mr. Speaker. that when Congress-
510120553|I will say to the gentleman from Texas . if he will permit me. that there are two items of the same character and we shall ask the House to nonconcur in both.
510120554|But what will the conferees on the partof the House do?
510120555|I can not say as to that now.
510120556|They will concur.
510120557|Will the conferees on the part of the House yield to the Senate conferees?
510120558|I am very much disposed to say that I shall not. I do not know as to the others.
510120559|I would ask my friend from Kansas or any member of the committee how much has been already expended upon the new gymnasium. I notice an appropriation for the payment of the debt on the new gymnasium.
510120560|I would say. Mr. Chairman. for the information of my friend from Texas . that that was built from funds contributed by private individuals. The Government did not contribute a dollar towards the erection of that gymnasium.
510120561|That is at Carlisle.
510120562|But in its construction and equipment there has been a burden of debt of $5.000 contracted. and as the Government has contributed nothing toward it. the Indian Office has recommended that we assume this indebtedness and pay it.
510120563|I find all through this bill not only increases of officials. but also increases of pay. by which a large number of officials will be fastened upon the Government with increased pay. It occurs to me that the conferees on the part of the House should insist that all such amendments be stricken out. The building of aschoolhouse to cost $25.000 at the Blackleet agency is extravagant and unnecessary. Ninetynine schoolhouses in every hundred. I might say nine hundred and ninetynine in every thousand. in the ULnited States do not cost onetenth of that.
510120564|They did not cost $1.500 each.
510120565|Not $1.500.
510120566|If it will not interrupt the gentleman. I wouldsuggest that this appropriation contemplates notonly the school building. but the supporting house. the dormitories. and all thatpertains to that industrial school.
510120567|It does notstate anything of thekind. Ibeg the gentlemans pardon. It says: Including construction of school building at Blackfeet agency in lMIontana. at a cost not exceeding 1F25.000. That is the proposition involved in the Senate amendment. The dotting of all our extreme Western country with these Indian school buildings at a cost of $25.090. at least $24.000 greater than the average cost of schoolhouses in the United States for the white children of the country. is an extravagance that will not meet the approval of the people.
510120568|A most extravagant proposition submitted here. inasmuch as it shocks the economic nerves of the gentleman from California .
510120569|I now yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from Missouri .
510120570|pro temnmpore. The gentleman from Texas has occupied nine minutes.
