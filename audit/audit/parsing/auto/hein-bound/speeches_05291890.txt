510072050|How large?
510072051|It is a place of 8.000 or about that large. Tt bids fair to become one of the largest cities on the seacoast. This buildinA is principally needed for a customhouse. There is a customhouse there. and the Government have to pay for the major part of the hotel there in which to transact the customhouse business.
510072052|Is not that the second bill for that Congressional district today 9
510072053|Yes. sir. that is the fact.
510072054|Getting along very well!
510072055|Are you a member of the Committee on Public Buildings and Grounds?
510072056|I am not. and I had a good deal of diffmculty in geting a favorable report on this bill.
510072057|I think the committee should refuse topass this bill. The chairman of the Committee on Public Buildings and Grounds has created a combination here fbr the purpose of dealing out public buildings to the faithful and the few who happen to be in favor with the committee. The committee seems to be loaded. The gentleman from Maine in control of this publicbuilding trust. no doubt a little frightened at the eagerness with which they take the pork. attempts to have the committee rise. but. like Smileys frog. it is loaded. and he can not get it up. The combination has somewhat the best ot the gentleman from Maine . and he can not stop the machine now when he would like to. I want to say in connection with this that this way of dealing out public buildings is all wrong. It is giving away the peoples money without question as to whether there is any merit in the demands or whether there is any public necessity for a public building in the several localities. And that is what we object to. I hope the committee will have this bill laid aside and not insist upon its consideration now. Let the committee go slow and consider this matter. We are not asking anything unreasonable. All we. ask isdue and proper consideration. We contend that at this point. at Newport News. there is not a present necessity for a public building. There is no statement of the population given in the report. The town is very small. It maybe a growing town. but my information is that it is simply a village. quite unpretentious and without sufficiefit public business to justify this expense. Now. I think the gentleman Who represents this district has no reason to complain. The committee have given him a public building today and he ought to be willing to wait a little while. to let this matter be investigated. so that we may know whether there is merit in the request for a public building in this locality. If Newport News is entitled to a public building. I am willing to vote for it. but I think the gentleman should give the committee an opportunity to know the full facts. There are other localities seeking appropriations here or the enactment of bills to give them public buildings in cases that are meritorious. I think those towns that have doubtful necessities should stand aside until those localities seeking public buildings where there is a pressing public necessity have been heard. I hope the committee will not pass this bill. The gentleman has fared well enough already at the hands of the committee. many millions of the peoples money are involved in these measures. let us proceed with care and not rush over these matterswith undue haste. Since I have been upon the floor asking for intelligent information concerning the necessity for a public building at certain points. a number of members have come to me and begged that I withdraw opposition. as it would interfere with the passage of their bills. This simply explains what I mean by combination. Bills for public buildings at doubtful places are called up. and members with measures that have merit are forced into voting for the one that they may secure the other. What an imposition on the taxpayer. I give notice here and now my voice and vote will be raised against such reckless extravagance and doubtful methods of legislation.
510072058|I desire to say in reply to my friend on the other side . and in answer to some gentlemen on this side of the House who have spoken in somewhat the same line. that the Committee on Public Buildings and Grounds has been doing just exactly what he proposes it should dothat is. out of a large pile of bills. two hundred and thirty in number. which have been referred to that committee. we have reported to the House those which we believe to be most meritorious. without regard to politics or any other consideration but merit. and it is a mere accident that when we came to examine the Calendar this morning we found a large majority of Republican bills high up on that Calendar. There has never been an instance within my recollection. and I am sure there has never been an instance when the question of the political complexion of the district or of the member who represented the district has been considered in that committee by either Republican or Democrat.
510072059|If the gentleman understood me to refer to the politics of the gentleman who represents this district he was mistaken.
510072060|I did not so understand the gentleman. but I am not talking to that point just now.
510072061|I will ask the gentleman from Maine whether this bill has not been called up out of its regular order.
510072062|I am coming to that in a minute. This bill was understood by me to be a Republican bill. and it has not been called up in the order in which it would have been called up had it been understood to be a Democratic bill. but two distinguished Democrats of this House. who I think will be believed as readily as any Democrat. and I do not know but as readily as anybody in the world . came to me and stated that we had made a mistake. that this was a Democratic bill and should have been called up previously. I asked them to go and assure themselves about it. They came back saying that they had done so. and then. because I supposed from the information which I obtained right here that this was a Democratic bill. I had it placed in the order in which it has been called up today. Now. so far as the merits of the bill are concerned they are before this committee. So far as the passage of the bill through the House is concerned. that question also is for this committee and for the House. and I assure gentlemen that. while I believe the bill has merits and should pass. I shall not grumble at whatever this committee or the House desires to do.
510072063|I think the gentleman misunderstood me. The question whether this bill is a Democratic measure or a Republican measure. whether it comes from a Democratic member or from a Republican member. is not the question here. That has nothing to do with the merits.
510072064|I did not speak of that in reply to the gentleman. but in reply to the suggestion which was made that I had brought the bill up out of its order.
510072065|And thatis just what we are objecting to here. for Republicans and Democrats to form a combination such as has been formed here today to endeavor to get through publicbuilding bills without reference to their merits.
510072066|"If the gentleman is cognizant of. or if he is a party to. any ""combination."" he has a right to testify to its existence. but he must not include me in it."
510072067|Mr. Chairman. I can say here and now that gentlemen have been running to and fro on this floor asking members not to object to their bills. saying that they had made an arrangement with the other side and that if they did not stand by that they could not get their bills through.
510072068|Well. if the gentleman expects to change human nature he will have a hard job.
510072069|I do not expect to do that. I would not attempt to change your nature.
510072070|No. because you would make it worse if you did.
510072071|That would be pretty hard to do.
510072072|Mr. Chairman. the question here is not whether this bill emanates from a Democrat or from a Republican. nor whether it is thesecond bill for a building in any particular Congressional district. The only question for us to determine as legislators is the question. Is this bill right ? Ought it to pass? Now. sir. I know something about the section of country where this proposed building is to be erected. On my first visit to Newport News. which was only a few years ago. there was but one building there. but today it is the great shipping port upon the Chesapeake Bay. and I believe that in a very few years it will be the gleat outgoing port for a large portion of the products of this country south of Mason and Dixons line. I believe that the exports that will go out through the capes will in a short time be greater than that which will go out from all the coast besides below Cape Charles. and I believe this to be one of the instances in which it will be the part of economy to erect a public building at once. This. I say. is one of those cases where it is true economy for the Government to erect a public building. not necessarily as a postoffice. but as a customhouse. A customhouse there is needed. a building in which the Government officials may have their offices and may have facilities for seeing that the Government is not defrauded of its revenues. Some gentlemen upon this floor do not seem to know of the commerce that is going out between those capes. nor how very rapidly it is growing in volume.
510072073|What is the population?
510072074|It is not a question of population. it is a question of trade. So far as the customhouse is concerned it is wholly a question of trade. and that is what I am trying to enforce upon this body. but some gentlemen seem to think that the number of men. women. and babies in a place must be ascertained before we can tell whether a customhouse is needed or not. A practical business man would secure the ground and erect the building now.
510072075|What are the customs receipts?
510072076|The exports last year were over $6.000.000. nearly $7.000.000.
510072077|And the receipts?
510072078|The receipts were correspondingly large. MALY 29.
510072079|Yes. I presume so. but I thought that perhaps the gentleman could give us some definite information on the subject.
510072080|The fact is. Mr. Chairman. as I stated before. that this commerce is increasing in a rapid ratio. It must necessarily increase and I have not a particle of doubt that by the time this proposed building is under roof the commerce of the place will be double what it is now. perhaps treble.
510072081|There is a matter of fact in relation to this bill which we have not yet ascertained. We have sent a clerk to the committeeroom to ascertain it. In the mean time f ask that the bill be passed over for the present. and taken up immediately after the next bill.
510072082|I do not see why that should be done. There is no reason why this matter should not be acted upon now as well as at any other time.
510072083|The gentleman from Virginia objects.
510072084|I hope that the gentleman will withdraw his objection.
510072085|This is the third Republican bil. called up in succession.
510072086|There may be a mistake. but it ought to be corrected.
510072087|I do not think the gentleman from Virginia can assist the passage of his bill by objecting to my proposition.
510072088|"Mr. Chairman. it seems to me we have not the information that this committee ought to have in order to act intelligently upon this bill. Nobody states definitely what the postal receipts at this place are. nobody knows what the custom receipts are. nobody knows what the population is. This is the second bill for this Congressional district which has been considered. and is about to be passed here today. Now there are in this country great cities that have no public buildings. there are very large Congressional districts that have had no consideration. and I submit that it is about time to ""go slow. I I want to say. Mr. Chairman. that in myopinion we are reducing ""the surplus"" with very great rapidity. Thejournals are getting a little hot here this afternoon with the motion we have got up. and there will be a combustion if we do not look out. In the interest of public buildings I suggest that we should check down a little. slow the speed of the machine. and take time enough to find out what need there is of this public building. and whether it can not wait until next winter before this Congressional district has a second public building."
510072089|I move to amend by striking out the last word.
510072090|If the gentleman will permit me. I will withdraw my objection to his request.
510072091|The gentleman from Virginia withdraws his objection. The gentleman from South Carolina asks unanimous consent that this bill be passed over for the present. Is there objection ?
510072092|I desire to be heard.
510072093|Does the gentleman object?
510072094|I desire to be heard on the bill for five minutes.
510072095|But the pending question is whether the bill shall be passed over temporarily.
510072096|I move to strike out the last word.
510072097|That was my motion. and if there is to be discussion I am entitled to the floor.
510072098|The pending question is on the request of the gentleman from South Carolina that this bill be passed over for the present.
510072099|I desire to be recognized.
510072100|I have the floor if there is to be discussion.
510072101|Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from South Carolina ? The Chair hears none.
510072102|I wish to state that the value of the imports at this town last year was $274.000.
510072103|(after a pause). Mr. Chairman. I will state the position of the Newport News bill. When the Calendar was arranged-
510072104|I rise to a point of order. I understood that the Newport News bill was withdrawn.
510072105|But I call it up again.
510072106|The bill was not withdrawn. but passed over for the present. and now the gentleman from South Carolina desires to call it up again.
510072107|I am stating why it was passed over.
510072108|I desire to be recognized.
510072109|The Chair will recognize the gentleman. if he desires it. after the gentleman from South Carolina has spoken.
510072110|Mr. Chairman. when the bill for a public building at Newport News was arranged in the Calendar order as first determined on by the committee. it was put in its right place. because a House bill was introduced by the gentleman from Virginia and the Senate bill was reported. but I and other gentlemen here had information. which it turns out was entirely erroneous. that the House bill bad been introduced by Mr. George D. Wise while a member of this House on the Democratic side. and relying upon that information and endeavoring to correct the arrangement. this bill was put in out of its order. In view of the facts. I move that it be reinstated in its proper place on the Calendar under the order of the House. It does not belong in the place it now occupies. and therefore I desire to withdraw it tbr the purpose I have stated. I hope the gentleman from North Carolina [Mr. CowLEs] will speak on some other bill. This came up by reason of a misapprehension and is deranging the order. causing injustice to gentlemen on both sides of the House.
510072111|Mr. Chairman. befbre the gentleman sits down I will ask him. in order to make this thing exact. whether he did not himself inform me-
510072112|I so informed the chairman of the committee. having erroneous information myself. That information being now found to be erroneous. the bill ought to be withdrawn. and take its proper order.
510072113|Does the gentleman withdraw the bill?
510072114|1 will ask to withdraw the bill.
510072115|The bill is withdrawn.
510072116|I can not understand why North Georgia should have all the money in the Treasury. Only yesterday twentyfive thousand-
510072117|This is a question of a public building. not dollars.
510072118|In the absence of objection. the appropriation clause in the bill will be stricken out.
510072119|That is embodied in the committee amendments and has been adopted. The bill as amended was laid aside to be reported to the House with the recommendation that it do pass.
510072120|In the absence of objection. the appropriating clause of the bill will be stricken out.
510072121|I would like to know if this is the second bill today for Rockford?
510072122|It is not. Perhaps the gentleman is thinking of Rockland. This is the only bill for Rockford. Mr. Chairman. Rockford is a very active. flourishing. business town of over 25.000 population. with immense manufacturing interests. and the business of the postoffice is so large that this last year it reached nearly $46.000. They need the public building badly. for the present rented office quarters are overcrowded and the inconvenience is increasing every day. I will not delay this committee by further details in behalf of a measure of such evident merit. The report of the Committee on Public Buildings and Grounds. where this bill was examined with much care and where I presented very full information touching the importance. the industries. and the wants of the city of Rockfbrd. states the more important facts. The bill as amended was laid aside to be reported to the House with the recommendation that it do pass.
510072123|I desire to have read from the Clerks desk an item of some interest bearing upon one of the bills presented today.
510072124|I desired to call the attention of the committee and of the House to the bill named in that veto message. because when it comes up for consideration in the House I imagine we will have but little time to discuss it there. I therefore take this means of introducing the subject. and also to call the attention of the gentleman who Dresides at the other end of the avenue. in the Executive Mansion. at the present time to the wisdom contained in that message in regard to the proposed measure and its application to many other bills of like nature. The erection of public buildings throughout the whole country is becoming a matter of very grave concern. They are getting to be almost as plentiful now as martin boxes. and they would be just about as much use as martin boxes in winter time if the gentlemen on both sides of this Chamber would unite with me to abolish the entire system of internalrevenue laws and tax. and reduce the tariff to a revenue basis. We could repeal these laws and get along without them.
510072125|"Oh. the postoffices get along very well. They always did without any such provision. We had very few public buildings erected for postoffices in the olden times. and we got along just about as well as we do now. But your common excuse was in the Fortyninth and Fiftieth Congresses. when you held up your hands in holy horror and asked. ""Do gentlemen intend to keep the money in the Treasury ?"" 1 Whenever there was an opportunity for appropriations of money. it was poured out by shovelfuls. There is no account taken of the extravagance. I say this is a very poor way to get rid of the money in the Treasury. That money represents the hard earnings of our people. It represents the sweat and toil of the nation. It comes from the burdens they have to bear. and I say the way to get rid of the surplus in the Treasury is to repeal the unjust tax laws which we have already on our statutebooks. both the exorbitant tariff and the inquisitorial and oppressive internalrevenue tax and system of taxation also."
510072126|I will yield to you directly. I believe I have an hour.
510072127|The gentleman is entitled to an hour.
510072128|"Now. I desire to say further that this matter of public buildings is getting to be as bad as the river and harbor bill. Why. sir. there are more jobs and mutualadmiration societies run under it than any other legislative proposition Ih the Houseregular ""you tickle me and Ill tickleyou I Isociety. Alen get together on both sides of the Chamber. they logroll and say. ""Now. what bills will you have put through?"" or. ""How much will you take?"" ""What bill will you have reported?"" ""What bills will you have called up?"" This is carried on to a great extent. it casts a disgrace upon our legislation. and it ought to stop here. These publicbuildiny bills ought to stand on their own merits or not at all. as the river and harbor appropriations ought to stand on their merits. I favor the erection of public buildings where they are absolutely needed for the accommodation of the Federal courts and for postoffices and customhouses. but in many instances where they have Federal courts they can be accommodated as in the past. when the business in the Federal courts in most of the interior districts at least was much larger than it is now. and when they were held in the county courthouses or State buildings being used for that purpose. Now. sir. I insist that this matter has gone far enough. Wearejust shoveling the money out of the Treasury by the millions. scattering it broadcast. here and there. indiscriminately. except that some portions of the countrythe district I represent. for instanceget very little. getting none at all in fact."
510072129|What is done with the money that is spent forpublic buildings. Where does it go?
510072130|"To the experts and artisans and the contractors. who for the most part live in Washington and other large cities. and under the iniquitous tax system we have. both by tariff and internal revenue. it is not very long before the money is brought back into the Treasury. and the people reap no advantage of it. It is not left with them long enough to answer their needs. Now. sir. if you repeal that iniquitous system. cut down the tariff to a revenue basis. and abolish the internalrevenue tax. especially the tax upon tobaccoa tax upon agriculture and a tax upon the labor and the sweat of the poor farming people of this country [applause on the Democratic side]-you will get rid of a good deal of the surplus in the Treasury without scattering it abroad without any proper necessity and leave the money in the pockets of the people where it belongs. I sympathize with my friend from Virginia . who has. I believe. one of the most meritorious bills upon the Calendar and has not been allowed to get it up for consideration. Like him I should have been in Richmond today. participating in the tribute to the memory of the honored dead. but for the duty which called me here. I sympathize with my friends who come here with certain jobs foisted upon them. I know their constituency foist them on them and say. "" You must get through a public building for this town or for that. or you will never get back to Congress any more."" I sympathize very much with them when that is the case. but if campaign money must be expendedand I am opposed to expending it. and think it is a disgrace to the people. and a disgrace to the men who spend it. and a pollution of the ballotbox. still. if it is to be spent. let it come out of the pockets of the men who want to profit by it. instead of coming out of the Treasury of the Government. thereby increasing the burdens of the people to serve individual necessity. Mr. Chairman. I believe I have-"
510072131|The Chair would suggest to the gentleman that there is nothing now before the committee.
510072132|I do not understand the Chair.
510072133|Possibly the bill had better be read before anything further is done.
510072134|Can I be recognized after the bill is read?
510072135|The Chair will take pleasure in recognizing the gentleman.
510072136|said: A parliamentaryinquiry. Mr. Chairman. The bill was read or commenced to be read before I began my remarks.
510072137|The Chair is informed that the bill was not read.
510072138|Did not the Clerk read the bill?
510072139|The bill was not read.
510072140|I stood here and listened to it. What was read. then ?
510072141|It was read by its title. possibly.
510072142|No. sir. the bill was read.
510072143|I ask unanimous consent that the billbe considered as read.
510072144|The Chair will state to the gentleman from North Carolina that the only item that has been read was the veto message which was sent to the Clerks desk by the gentleman. The bill has not been read. and the gentleman confounds the veto message with the bill. The reading of the bill was resumed and concluded.
510072145|Mr. Chairman. I call the attention of the House to another fact in connection with this Bar Harbor bill. and that is that the bill which called forth that most excellent veto message of Mr. Cleveland. which I think will make very good reading for many of our friends now and which I am abundantly gratified is to go into the RECORD where it does. called for $25.000.
510072146|Will my friend allow me to ask him a question?
510072147|Not now. That bill. sir. went to the President. and upon investigation of the full facts as to the necessity for this building. he vetoed that bill calling for $25.000 and sent it back to this House with his reasons therefor. and his veto was indorsed by the House. Now. sir. this bill. as I understood the reading. calls for $75.000 for the erection of a public building at Bar Harbor. three times the amount called for by the bill vetoed by President Cleveland. I now yield the remainder of my time to the gentleman from Illinois .
510072148|Mr. Chairman. I do not wish to take up the time of the committee interfering with the passage of bills of a meritorious character. but )chile this veto message is before the committee I wish to call the attention ofthe gentleman from Maine . the chairman of the committee. to the factthat hestated when the bill was pending that it was vetoed by President Cleveland for the reason that the amount appropriated was insufficient.
510072149|That was one of the reasons.
510072150|That is the way I remember his statement. and he gave it without any modification. Now. if he will read that veto he will find the reason for it was because President Cleveland did not consider it necessary to erect a public building at that place. He thought if there should be a public building erected there it should be done under some general law that would give that postoffice no advantage over postoffices of the same class. Now. Mr. Chairman. it will be seen that there are three clerks there. and five clerks during the summer. and yet this bill calls for $75.000. amounting to $15.000 for each clerk. for a postoffice to accommodate the people of that little town. thus making the people in districts who have better towns pay taxes to erect this building. I say if there is one thing that would induce me to oppose a meritorious bill advocated by one of my colleagues on this floor it would be to see him join in combinations to assist in putting a bill of this character through to help out his own bill.which ought to stand upon its own merits. For one I am opposed to passing such bills as that. and desire to give notice now that when this bill comes up in the House I will demand the yeas and nays upon its passage.
510072151|"I desire to say in response to the gentleman from Illinois that the amount appropriated by the bill vetoed was only $25.000. and President Cleveland stated that ""the postmaster expressed the opinion that a proper site alone would cost from $20.000 to $30.000."
510072152|That is a part of the veto message. Read on further.
510072153|You read the remainder of it. and I do not dispute your word.
510072154|Before concluding. he says it was not. necessary.
510072155|The question is on the amendment. which the Clerk will read.
510072156|I call up the bill for a public building at Sheboygan. Wis.
510072157|I move that the committee do now rise:
510072158|I demand tellers. Tellers were ordered. and the Chairman appointed Mr. ROGERS and
510072159|The committee again divided. and the tellers reportedayes 44. noes So the motion was agreed to. The committee accordingly rose. and the Speaker having resumed the chair. Mr. BuRRows. from the Committee of the Whole. reported that they had had under consideration. under the special order of the House. bills reported from the Committee on Public Buildings and Grounds. and had directed him to report back to the House bills for the erection of public buildings with sundry amendments. and with the recommendation that they be passed as amended.
510072160|Mr. Speaker. I ask unanimous consent for the present consideration of the resolution which I send to the desk.
510072161|Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Michigan?
510072162|Before we grant unanimous consent. I wish to ask what is the meaningof this?
510072163|Simply to recall the bill.
510072164|What is the matter with the bill?
510072165|The object is to recall the bill for the purpose of making a correction in it.
510072166|What sort of a correction. clerical or otherwise?
510072167|I do not know what the correction will be when the bill comes back. This resolution is simply to recall the bill.
510072168|I should think that before we recall a bill from the President we ought to know what the purpose is in recalling it.
510072169|It is a usual thing.
510072170|That is one of the reasons why I am inquiring about it. These errors are getting to be so usual that I want to know what the trouble with this bill is before I give consent to its recall.
510072171|I can not say what the exact trouble with it is. but the friends of the bill desire to have it recalled. I am just advised by my colleague that there is a single amendment which the Secretary of War desires to have inserted in the bill.
510072172|What is the amendment?
510072173|It is in regard to the waste into Portage Lake.
510072174|Is there objection to the present consideration of the resolution ?
510072175|Mr. Speaker. I ask unanimous consent of the House to allow my colleague to prefer a request to the House. and that he have one minute to state the reasons therefor.
510072176|I will state briefly that. very much to my surprise and to the surprise of the people who seLt me here. a majority of the Committee on Elections have decided that they can do without TURPIN any longer. and they have named rext Tuesday as the day to put him upon the rack. Therefore I ask unanimous consent for the consideration of the bill which I send to the desk. and which. I will say. was the third bill on the Democratic side in regular order on the Calendar. It is a publicbuilding bill. a meritorious case.
510072177|The Chair does not consider that a request that has yet been submitted to the House. The Chair lays before the House the following personal requests of members-
510072178|Mr. Speaker. the request that I made was that my colleague should have one minute to prefer a request for unanimous consent and to state reasons therefor.
510072179|That was not submitted to the House.
510072180|It is made now for submission to the House.
510072181|My colleague now asks unanimous consent that the Committee of the Whole be discharged from the further consideration of the bill which he has indicated.
510072182|Unanimous consent was asked that the gentleman might make a statement. That is the way the Chair understood it. Is the Chair mistaken?
510072183|I myself asked unanimous consent to make a statement.
510072184|I asked consent for my colleague to make a request of the House for unanimous consent and to state the reasons therefor. and he has made his statement and his request.
510072185|The gentleman from Alabama has made a request. a very reasoiiable one. which I hope will be granted.
510072186|The Chair understood the request to be that the gentleman should be allowed to make a statement.
510072187|That was my colleagues request. I have made a request myself for unanimous consent to take up this bill.
510072188|Mr. Speaker. the request I made was that my colleague might be allowed to ask the House for unanimous consent for the consideration of a measure and might have one minute to state the reasons therefor. and he has had the opportunity and he has made the statement and asked the unanimous consent of the Houso to consider the bill which he has indicated.
510072189|Mr. Speaker. I will have no objection to the gentlemans request for unanimous consent provided the same courtesy is extended to myself as Representative of the Third district of Ohio.
510072190|You are not in the same fix.
510072191|I am.
510072192|Why? Simply because my bill is on the Calendar and has not been reached. and my constituents sent me here to get that bill passed.
510072193|You are going to stay here. but my friend is not going to stay here.
510072194|Oh. I know too well. I have been there myself.
510072195|The statement of the gentleman from Ohio is equivalent to an objection.
510072196|The Clerk will read the first bill reported from the Committee of the Whole on the state of the Union.
510072197|Do I understand that the Chair declines to submit the request of my colleague ?
510072198|The gentleman from Ohio has made an obiection.
510072199|I did not so understand.
510072200|The gentleman from Ohio has made an objection. The Clerk will proceed.
510072201|The gentleman from Ohio said he would not object if he could have the same privilege.
510072202|(having put the question on agreeing to the amendments). The ayes seem to have it.
510072203|Division! The question being again taken. there wereayes 74. noes none.
