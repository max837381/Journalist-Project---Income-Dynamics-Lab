660243389|I am not questioning the justice of the claim. but I have in mind. as a member of the Committee on Claims. bills pending before the committee that have been there for years. on the question of refund of taxes. and the gentleman from Michigan has one for the refund of a fine. I just wondered why J . D. Spreckels & Bros. Co. did not take their course through the Committee on Claims and havea bill introduced for their relief instead of providing for it in the sundry civil bill?
660243390|I am advised that in cases of this kind. where a collection had been made through mistake in judgmentan err6neous collecti6inreimburseients have always been carried on this bill.
660243391|The Clerk will read.
660243392|Mr. Chairman. I make a point of order against the following portion of the paragraph. On page 159. beginning with line 23: And for such per diem together with actual traveling expenses of officers and employees of the Bureau of Naturalization in Washington while absent on official duty outside of the District of Columbia. . For the reason that it is new legislation and unauthorized by law. I call the chairmans attention to the fact that the pter diem traveling expenses are fixed by law. This is an attempt to enlarge it and leave it unlimited. without any anount fixed even. and to let them be confined to whatever may be termed actual traveling expenses. without any limitation on them whatever. There is no law for it. and it is unauthorized.
660243393|This does not change the law. The general law provides that the limit shall be a per diem of $4. and not to exceed $5 actual expenses.
660243394|The Chair will suggest that this amendment does not limit it to $5.
660243395|That is existing law. There is nothing in this provision that gives them the right to exceed what is provided in the general statute.
660243396|It is clearly an appropriation. Money under the law could not be paid out of ain appropriation. This is merely an appropriation. and the money that is expended must be expended under the law. This does not change the law.
660243397|If there is law for it. there is no ..eed for this appropriation.
660243398|Oh. yes. There is need for appro. priation. This is merely descriptive of the purpose of the appropriation.
660243399|The chairman is a good lawyer. and lie knows that under the provisions of this clause. as written. it would not be limited necessarily to the $5 a day as a maximum.
660243400|Mr. Chairman. of course. this is merely descriptive of what the $525.000.at the end of the par. graph is for. It does not enlarge.the law or. change the law. and without the language the $525.000 could not be paid for per diem expenses as the law provides. because there must be av appropriation as well a law for the payment of the noney. This does not change the law.
660243401|Mr. Chairman. the law provides as follows: On and after July 1. 1914. unless otherwise expressly provided by law. no officer or employee of the United States shall be allowed or paid any sum in excess of expenses actually incurred for subsistence while traveling on duty outside of the District of Columbia and away from his designated post of duty. nor any sum for such expenses actually incurred in excess of $5 a day. Now. we are not changing that law. This appropriation. as stated by the gentlema4 from Illinois is just descriptive of the purpose for which the money can be expended.
660243402|The Chair is ready to rule. The !Chair wats under the impression. when the point of order was first raised. that the purpose of this language was to repeal the law which limits the actual expenses which may be allowed to an officer of tel Government while traveling on official business to $5. On careful examination of the provision the Chair is of the opinion that the provision to which the gentleman from Texas makes the point of order does not change the existing law. and would not authorize the allowance of traveling expenses in excess of the amount fixed by law. but is simply an appropriation of an amount for the purpose of .payment of the expense which is authorized by law.
660243403|Mr. Chairman. under tie construction placed upon the law by the Chairman. the department would necessarily be guided by it. and therefore I withdraw the poiit of order.
660243404|The Chair overrules the point of order. and the Clerk will read.
660243405|Mr. Chairman. I offer an amendment.
660243406|The gentleman from New York offers an amendment. which the Clerk will report.
660243407|Mr. Chairman. I make the point of order against the amendment.
660243408|The gentleman froit California makes a point of order against the alendment.
660243409|The point of order is that it is new legislation. The law now requires. under the fourth section of the act of June 29. 1906Thirtyfourth Statutes at Large. part 1. page 596that tile party on application for naturalization shall present a certificate of his landing. and this would repeal that. The legislative. executive. and judicial appropriation bill. which came in here some time ago. carried an amendment of that kind. and the Chair held it out of order. STile CHAIRMAN. Does the gentleman from New York desire to be heard on the point of order?
660243410|I do. By the adoption of this amendment we would save at least $5.000. reducing the amount froin $525.000 to $520.000. It would do away with the proposition of requiring every applicant for citizenship to produce a certificate of arrival. I hold a letter in my hand from the Assistant Secretary of Labor. dated April. 30. 1920. showing conclusively that at the port of New York at the present time there are 10.000 such. applications that can not be acted upon. and that they are behind at least five months in acting upon them. They are behind at Montreal several months. and at various other ports the same regrettable condition prevails. I may also add that the Committee on Immigration and Naturalization has reported a bill. H. R. .3646. which repeals the ecrtificateofarrival provision. and by the adoption of this amendment we would relieve at least a dozen clerks from doing this useless work and at the same time save $5.000. The newspapers and others interested in having aliens become American citizens. including the Bureau of Naturalization. are all in favorof the adoption of this amendment.
660243411|The Chair is ready to rule. The amendn nt of the gentleman from New York inserts the following provision in the paragraph under consideration: And the requirement in section 4 of the act of June 29. 1906 (34 Stat. L.. pt. 1. p. 596). that ail alien shall file a certificate on arrival. from the )epartment of Labor. with the clerk of the court at the time of filing a petition for naturalization is hereby repealed. $520.000. To this proposed amendment the gentleman from California makes the point of order that it is new legislation and therefore not in order on an appropriation bill. The gentleman from New York contends that the amendment is in order under the Holman rule. because it reduces expenditures. The Chair thinks that the Holman rule. properly construed. so far as it relates to amendments offered by a Member on the floor. only permits legislation in the sense of legislation reducing the number or salary of officers of the United States or the compensation fixed by law to be paid out of the Treasury of the United States to such officer. or by reduction of the amounts of money carried by the bill.. that the Holman rule does not contemplate the repeal. or make in order amendments which in effect repeal. the substdrtiveprovisions of law. The Chair is aware of the fact that the opinion lie is now .rendering is in some respects not in line With the decisions which have recently been rendered by chairmen of the Colmittee of the Whole. The Chair will not at this time undertake to go into those precedents. The Chair is of the opinion that an amendment repealing substantive provisions of law is not in order under the Holnlan rule. The Chair therefore sustains the point of order.
660243412|Mr. Chairman. I ask unanimous consent to insert in the RECORD a letter from the Department of Labor on the subject.
660243413|The gehtleman from New York asks unanimous consent to extend his remarks by inserting a letter from the Secretary of Labor. Is there objection?
660243414|The Clerk will read.
660243415|I move to strike out the last word. I notice under this heading which carries this $20.000 appropriation there is an item for printing and binding. The gentleman will remember the very large book which this Housing Corporation got outan illustrated book with fine steel engravings in it. and so forth. It musthave cost a great deal of money. Isthe chairman going to permit that to be done over again?
660243416|If the chairman of the Committee on Apropriatiofis could stop some of this useless printing and binding he would certainly do it. That is not the only department of the Government that has engaged in this practice. One newspaper has sent me the dope that it received in one week from all the departments of the Government. Here it is. Most of the letters unopened. They say they do not open them.
660243417|But the gentleman is going far afield froiu the subject. -I am confining it to this Housing Corporation. which got out this very large illustrated book with steel engravings in it. -Is that going to be done over again this year out of this $20.000? -
660243418|At the time they got out that book they had unlimited funds. I do not think they propose to engage in any. printing of that kind. It was the intention of the committee that the printing and binding and other expenses should necessarily be very limited. The Housing Corporation is a liquidating proposition. There is a bill now in conference-
660243419|Then if they. go beyond the liquidating proposition in this printing and binding. they will go beyond the express will of this Congress?
660243420|They certainly will. They certainly would not be warranted in going to any expense in republishing the book to which the gentleman refers. or anything like it.
660243421|Willthe gentleman yield for a question?
660243422|Certainly.
660243423|: Is there no way in the world to stop the departments from running their printing presses?
660243424|"I do not know. There ought tobe. Here Is one publication entitled. ""Preface to a Report of the United States Food Administration. by Herbert Hoover. April. 1920."" Here are three copies of it received by one newspaper on one day. all printed on a very expensive calendared paper. Here are other reports. from all the departments. coming to this one newspaper every week. They say they do not read them. do not open them. that they throw them in the wastebasket. yet these Government clerks. 100.000of them. are here in Washihgton. and it must be necessary to keep a great manyof them just sending out this useless stuff."
660243425|I know that half the country newspapers protest against receiving these things at all.
660243426|Certainly. and they are objecting to the useless waste of paper in this way. which deprives them of the paper they would like to have to publish their little papers.
660243427|Can we not stop it?
660243428|It is an administrative proposition. The Congress can not run the legislative branch and the administrative branch too.
660243429|If we cut off this $20.000. they would not have the $20.000 .to spend.
660243430|The United States Housing Corporation have about $60.000.000 worth of property. They are selling that property. and selling it on payments. There is a good deal in the way of notices and things of that kind that must be sent to buyers. and for that purpose they must have a fund.
660243431|Mr. Chairman. it is not always so easy to control these printing expenses. We may cut down the appropriation. Very recently some of the departments sent in deficiency estimates for appropriations and said that they were absolutely essential. that they must have additional money in order to be able to print the necessary data from day to day. things that ought to be printed. things that everybody believes ought to be printed. We can not specify in an appropriation bill in every case just what documents shall be printed with the money appropriated. This sort of extravagance in printing is not chargeable to any political administration. It is just the natural tendency- and desire of men who wish to put into print something that has emanated from their brainsor lack of brainsand It is not entirely confined to administrative officers. vades even the sanctity of this Chamber. and sometimes I have suspected that it has even reached the person of my beloved friend from Texas. the best medium on Gods green earth with whlici to reach the people of the United States. because it is absolutely uncensored. and the newspapers are not.
660243432|People do not read the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD. The newspapers which receive the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD. as a rule. throw it in the wastebasket without taking off the cover. and nearly everybody else does.
660243433|The people are beginning to read It.
660243434|The gentleman from Texas ieads the CONGRESSIONAL ]RECORD because he has so much in it.
660243435|And the best things I ever read in it are speeches made in fights conducted on the floor by the distinguished gentleman from Illinois .
660243436|Oh. they were good. but I did not take the trouble to read them.
660243437|Mr. Chairman. on this subject of printing unnecessary documents the statement has been very properly made that Congress is not always responsible for what the heads of the executive departments print..but I want to take this occasion to call the attention of the House to the fact that each day there is sent to the membership the House Calendar. which. iI my opinion. contains quite a good deal of unnecessary matter. Since I have been a Member of the House. the Sixtysixth Congress is the first Congress in which that has been done. Heretofore we got our calendars over at the House document room or down at the desk whenever we wanted them. Now. I have no complaint to make at the custom of sending out the House Calendar to the offices of Members. but in that calendar is printed an index of bills. The whole document makes 108 pages daily. of which only 30 pages are devoted to the House Calendar and the other seventyodd pages consist of an index that is printed from day to day. and is practically a reprint every day. It is a waste of 30.000 pages of good white paper every day. and it occurs to me that a more businesslike and sensible method could be devised for printing the calendar. It Is absolutely unnecessary to print this index of bills oftener than once a week. The printing of those 70 pages every day is nothing but waste and should be stopped. I made this suggestion to time Clerk of the House some time ago. but he has not seen fit to make any change. I hope those in charge of the printing of the calendar will devise some method to stop it. The item. of course..is not so very large. so far as money is concerned. but I am opposed to waste in any form. and the instance I have pointed out is a conspicuous example of it. and it is right under the nose of Congress.
660243438|Mr. Chairman. the calendar used to be printed three times a week. I always thought myself that that was a sufficient number. but the House at one time concluded that It ought to have the calendar printed every day. and it has been printed every day. Now. the most valuable part of the calendar is the index.
660243439|Will the gentleman yield?
660243440|It occurs to me that the index printed in the calendars is practically identical with what is known as the weekly or monthly compendium compiled under the direction of. Mr. Loomis of theHouse.
660243441|Which I think is practically valueless.
660243442|One or the other ought to be discontinued. it looks to me like an exact duplication. The House is free in complaining about duplication in the Government departments. Let us stop it in our own printing.
660243443|They are not a duplication at all.
660243444|Does not the gentleman from Illinois admit that they are substantially a duplication of each other?
660243445|I will be frank with the gentleman and say that I have at different times casually examined Air. Loomiss publication. It is of no value. to me whatever and no value in my office. The calendar is. The daily calendar is carefully examined every day in my office. If it was only published once a week I would get flong. as far as I am concerned. An index to do any good must be up t( date. There is where Members look to see the status of legislation. Every day we are asked in letters. and so forth. concerning the status of various pieces of legislation. If a bill has been reported to the House or passed by the House the index in the calendar gives the information. That is the way I acquire my information. I do not know how others get theirs. I do not believe in duplication of work. I think if we had a calendar printed two or three times a week it would be sufficient.
660243446|May I ask the gentleman a qiestion?
660243447|Certainly.
660243448|In view of the great experience of the gentleman and the great respect I have for his opinion. I wantto ask him whether he thinks it would be worth while to undertake some method of notifying Members a little in advance of the business which is to be transacted the following day ?
660243449|It is not possible. any more than it is possible in court. In court. they give notice of the cases that will be called on a certain day. and yet frequently I have had cases on call for three or four weeks without being reached.
660243450|I have found that in other legislative bodiesof course. the analogy may not be a strong one between the procedure possible hereand that of other bodiesthat such a practice obtains. For instance. in the French Assembly there is a notification given tile evening before of business to be brought up at the next session. and so in Germany. and so in a modified way in England. In 1861 there was a commission appointed in England by the House of Commons to revise the rules of that body. and on that commission were such men as Disraeli. Palmerston. and Bright. They brought in a report stressing it as something of the greatest importance that the House should know in advance the business to be transacted at a particular session. and then adhere to the program. I have thought that something of that kind might be devised here.
660243451|I do not think it is possible. although I am free to say that I am not caught by surprise at anything that comes up. I think I can tell. as a rule. a day or three days ahead what is coming up better than the men that bring it up.
660243452|May I say a word further. because I am extremuely anxious to get the genltlemans opinion? I think in the extra session we acted on 21 matters under rules which were brought in by the Committee on Rules. The matters referred to in those rules. with a single exception. were taken up immediately on the adoption of the rules. I do not see how anybody could have known in advance. unless lie was in the confidence of the Rules Comlmittee or in the confidence of the leaders of the majority wvlm are largely responsible for the course of business iil the House. wlat was coming up. It seems to me it might be understood that a matter to which a special rule pertains should not be taken up. except in case of enmergency. until. say the day after the rule is adopted.
660243453|The gentleman proposes a niethod of 1killing time. Take this case that we have today. Here is the sunldry civil bill. The majority leader said the other day that we would finish it last week* I did not think that we could finish it before the end of this week. Both of us are mistaken. It comes up today with 30 pages unread. It might have been finished at 2 oclock. Then what are you going to do. adjourn or go to something else?
660243454|Go fishing.
660243455|Mr. Chairman. I would like to have the gentlemans time extended 2 minutes.
660243456|The gentleman from Missouri asks unainimous consent that the time of the gentleman from Illinois be extended two minutes. Is there objection?
660243457|"Mr. Chairman. in the first place I want to remark that the gentleman from Illinois owes it to .the House to get up some day and make a full exposition of how lie learns so much about the business of the House. I have been industrious. but not as industrious as he has. Now. as to the matter in controversy. why not have a bulletin .board at the corner of the desk. like they have in churches. Somewhere about the pulpit they have a board on which a statement is made of the hymns that they are going to sing. in ilarge letters. so that everybody in the congregation can see what they are. I do not see why that could not be done here. The Rules Committee ought to be compelled to give 24 hours notice every time it brings in a rule. They bring it on the House suddenly. and the House does not know a thing oil the face of the earth about -%-.hat is in the ruleno one except the Rules Committee. and several of that committee do not know it. for some of them do not attend the meetings. One must go to the gentleman fron Kansas to find out when lie is going tobring this rule up. .Every day 25 or 30 men will come to me. or pass where I am sitting and ask me what is going to come up tomorrow. .or when a.certain thing is going to come up. I do not know. and there is no way of finding out. I go over and ask Mr. MONDELL. and .he does not know. I do not think there is any intentional effort .to keep the House in a fog about what is coming up. but people .ought to have fair notice because they are interested in some bills and not interested in others. Take tile"" chickenfeed"" business. as the gentleman from • Illinois terms it. which comes up on Unanimous Consent Calendar day. Half of the Members in the House do not care three whoops about it. and they do not want to be dragged over here and kept here. A few make a specialty of it. as the gentleman from Illinois does. He knows what is coming up on the calendar and what he is going to do about it. He already has his amendments fixed. and he will get hold of a fellow here and worry him nearly into insanity. and then finally .state to him that if lie will accept his amendments. which he already has typewritten. lie will not object to his bill. In order to get the bill through in some shape. the man interested in it .will accept. any amnendment on earth that the gentleman from Illinois suggests."
660243458|And they are always good ones.
660243459|Most of them are good ones. I admit that. The records of this House for the last 10 years will show that the gentleman has had more bills through and more amendments put on bills than any 10 other men in the House. He pursues that course. and he ought to get down here and explain how lie does it. so that somebody else can have as much information as he has. if that is possible. which I doubt.
660243460|Mr. Chairman. I do not ask five minutes to explain how I do it. but I do ask unanimous consent to proceed for five minutes.
660243461|Is there objection?
660243462|"The gentleman from Virginia . one of the ablest Members of the House. suggests that in other parliamentary bodies they are able to tell in advance what is coming up for consideration. That is frequently done In State legislatures. where bills are called on the first. second. and third reading. and it is not difficult to determine. There is no other Government in the world that has our form of irresponsible executive government. It is not difficllt in other parliamentary bodies. where the executive consists of members of the legislative branch of the government. who have control of legislation. so long as they have the confidence of the chamher and remain in power. to tell what is coming up. When they lose power they go out of office. They determine what is coming up. and it is not difficult to do so. In this body there are a good many different committees. many. of them of practically equal influence. and there is a constant strife between members of committees in this House who have reported bills as to which bill shall be taken up in preference to bills reported from other committees. There is no call of the calendar in this House. and if there were. we probably never would get through business. The only calendar that is called is the Unanimous Consent Calendar. and that is an entirely different thing from calling the calendar as it is usually understood. We have our form of government. with no centralization of authority in the legislative branch. and there can not be as long as we have our present form of Government. and there will always be this strife of effort on the part of Members and committees to have considered first the bills in which they are interested. You never can tell very far in advance how that will come out. Whenever there has been any centralization of authority in this House. there has been an outcry against it. Take the cry of "" Cannonism"" in this House a few years ago. The former Speaker ofthis House. Mr. CANNON. had working under him. not an autocratic organization at all. but the smoothest working legislative machinery that has ever been known in this House. There was not very much controversy. Men were given an opportunity. More legislation was enacted during that period than during any other period of Congress. but there was an outcry against it. as there will be shortly against the power of the Committee on Rules. which constantly will seek to assume additional control of the House. Whenever you get this centralization of authority. you get with it the fight against it. because those who are not given preference are opposed to it. There are a great many bills on the calendar now that gentlemen want to have passed. Most of them ought never to be passed. but the Members who are interested in them want to get them considered. You can not tell very far in advance just the minute when something will come up. but there is one thing you can all do. if you will. You can all be prepared for the bills in which you are interested whenever they do come up. and that is not a difficult thing to do. That is what I do."
660243463|Mr. Chairman. I make the point of order against .the paragraph beginning on line 23. page 161. and ending on line 2. page 162. as being upauthorized by law.
660243464|Mr. Chairman. will the gentleman withhold the point of order for a moment?
660243465|The bill has passed both Houses which terminates the activities of the Housing Corporation. It transfers to the Treasury Department the function of winding up this establishment. All that is intended here is to make the appropriation and permit this appropriation to follow the transfer.
660243466|Mr. Chairman. will the gentleman yield?
660243467|The gentleman admitted just a few moments ago that this Housing Corporation has in its possession millions of dollars worth of property and cash.
660243468|Yes. but we have provided that that shall not be available. and as the cash comes in it must be covered into the Treasury of the United States.
660243469|"But this particular paragraph provides that the appropriations made herein under the title ""United States Housing Corporation"" shall be available for expenditure by the agency or agencies of the public service having jurisdiction of the affairs of the said corporation."
660243470|I will say to the gentleman that when we drew this provision it was not known. and I do not personally know now. just what the conferees have agreed to as to the agencies that will be intrusted with winding up the affairs of this company.
660243471|When this bill becomes a law there will be no need for this clause. will there?
660243472|Yes. and that is just the reason it is put in. Unless this provision is carried if we turn over to the Secretary of the Treasury the duty of winding up the United States Housing Corporation. he will have approximately $50.000.000 worth of collections to make and will have no funds to hire clerks unless this appropriation follows it.
660243473|If this clause goes in. has not this Housing Corporation authority under it to expend all--
660243474|No. Congress has provided that the receipts shall be covered into the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts. and we must appropriate-
660243475|Then I withdraw the point of order.
660243476|The gentleman from Iowa said that the pending bill proposing to repeal the act creating the
660243477|1 said activities.
660243478|Well. activities. I desire to call the gentle.mans attention to the fact thatthe House bill provided that the .:Plaza buildingsthe Government hotelsshould be put -under -the Public Buildings Commission. The Senate bill provides that these buildings shall !be put under -the Treasury Depart-. :ment along with the balance of these war buildings throughout the country. I may add ithat we are to .have a conference with -the Senate conferees at:3 oclock this afternoon on that question .and -on itwo or three other tquestions -of difference between the .two Houses. Of course. I have .no idea what agreement is likely to be reached. because we have not yet had -a meeting .of .the conferees and have discussed tie :subject -only informally and briefly. If .the *Housing Corporation. as proposed by the Senate amendment. is to be continued -until June 30and in view of the lapse of time I think now -that this should be done.and these Plaza buildings are transferred to the Treasury De*lartment. :as proposed by the Senate. and -continued for another.year. I take .it that :the provisions which this sundry civil .bill -contains for the .force -necessary to conduct that work -for !the ensuing fiscal .year is perhaps not in -excess -of what -the work will require. although I have not gone into that in :great detail. I understand that the gentleman from Iowa has had .extensive ihearings on the -question and understands ithe whole -situation. and 1 am willing vto trust his judgment .on it. so far as I am personally concerned on that point.
660243479|thank the gentleman for the .correction.
660243480|The point of order is withdrawn. and the Clerk will read.
660243481|Mr. Chairman. I make the.point of order against the paragraph as being legislation on an appropriation bill and unauthorized by law.
660243482|Will the gentleman withhold that for .a moment?
660243483|I do.
660243484|There was carried in the current appropriation $40.000 for this service. This is one of the warime services which was continued under the bill which -was reported .out last .year.
660243485|But ithereis no law authorizing this.
660243486|There is no.law authorizing it. but there is a bill that has already passed .the House creating this -very -department-
660243487|And hungupat the other end of theCapitol?
660243488|Yes-. the Senate has not acted upon -it. but here is a force already at work. and I am told they are doing good .work. The committee went into this matter somewhat in detail in regard to the work that that bureau. headed by women.-attempting to help solvethe.problems of women-
660243489|I will say to the -chairmau if lie -wants to save time. he linows it is subject to the point of -order-
660243490|I do.
660243491|And I am -goingto make it eventually. but if lie wants to save time. -unless -he wants to make a -statement-
660243492|I was in hope -I might succeed in removing any objection th& gentleman night have. :but if it is a useless thing. of course-
660243493|I do -not think -the -gentleman can convince me on this and the twosubsequent items. I -make the pointof order.
660243494|The gentleman -makes the point -of order. The Chair sustains the -point of order. and theClerk will read.
660243495|read -as follows:
660243496|Mr. Chairman. I maike the point of order that this is new legislation and unauthorized by law.
660243497|Will tIe gentleman reserve -it -so that we can .understand what is -meant-
660243498|"I reserve it -for a nomment. :but .I can tell .the gentleman what is meant by it. This department is .sening these .negro organizers down into my colleagues State and .States like Georgia. .Alabama. Mississippi. and the -Carolinas. to .unfonize -negro farm workers. -union ize negro cooks in -your pantry and -itchen. to insist on their charging wages up ito :$75. :$80. :$90. and ..even -.$100 a month and to ..Nork .only 7 and 8 hours per day. This -is what is .known as "":negro economics."" I make the point of order. Mr. Chairman."
660243499|Does the gentleman from Iowa desire to be heard on the point of order?
660243500|Mr. Chairman. I assumed that perhaps the same 1uling that was made last year in the -employment service would apply to this. but I want to say to .thegentleman from Texas. if I may digress .just a minute. that -there were some very learned negro gentlemen who came before the committee. men with college educations. who plead for this appropriation .asked for bythe .Secretary.
660243501|Just a.minute. Now. I want to give their point of view. The committee after weighing the matter decided to give something. Now they felt this way. The .Government has a department -here :that has -a large. appropriation for the Indian. We recognize the Indian. Werecognize the .Indian Service in -the United States. and -we have a large bureau in the Department .of the Interior dealing with the Indian. Now the colored men say. we are advised -by these men. and I will say fo the gentleman I. know very little about the problem-
660243502|Will :the gentleman .let me give him some information? .I :know something :about. it.
660243503|That the colored man lwas not recognized. -and it was felt that his efficiency could be improved. that his useful.ness could be :extended. that -his power to produce could be made more generally effective if he -felt that he .was some -part iof ithe Government in some -way so 2far as the people of 111s •own race -was concerned. Now. ithe Secretary -of Labor has the :right. .it seems to me. to .create in his -department a sort of bureau of this kind. He :could employ these men. but he does not .do it. and 1he comes to the Congress and -wants to .know whether it is thewill of the Congress thatbhe .should do it. -and the committee felt that this amouft .of money might well be .expended for ithis race .and -felt that if they could .extend their .usefulness and :their power and their .production by being -recog.nized. the committee was willing -to grant that recognition.
660243504|Will the gentleman yield? 1r. -GOOD. I -will -yield.
660243505|"Every single !negro in mydistrict. land there :are Jots of them. is :my friend and will. go the limit for me. and .I want to say to -the gentleman that -the :Secretary of Labor has .already had for -two years employed in his department one :iegro. whom lie calls Director :of Negro Economics. drawing .a -salary of $4.380. le .calls him ""Doctor"" Soandso. -trying to formn a basis for that kind of a salary. And he has another.negro down there. -whom he calls ""Assistant Director of Negro :Economics."" who has been drawing a salary of $1.740 with the -bonus. I stated -whatthey have been doing:in the iSouth ina moment ago and what .they ihave been doing in the Southwest. .and I -want to say that they ihave been :stirring .up strife and .animosity in .this race -of ipeople against the :best friends :they .lave on Gods green .earth. -and I am not in .favor of spending this money for thepurpose of .stirring up strife."
660243506|iof Tennessee. ir. Clairman. in addition -to -what the .gentleman from Iowa .[Mr. GooD] said. ithink it .fair :to say :that those who appeared before the committee in support -of this appropriation disdlaimed any such -objector intention as the :gentleman from .Texas -[Mr. B.AXToNj ihas ioutlined. They based :their :claim -entirely :upon what the gentleman from Iowa -has stated. :upon the :idea .that if.some .recognition. -whether it be great or:small. -was :given to -:the negro population .of -the country. jit would promote a -better feeling of good will on their part. :and -that this particular work .was devoted :to stimulating the efficiency of the negro. in stimulating his desire to save and :to purchase a home. .and .promoting his general welfare. Andthey put it upon the idea that -it was notonly .a .service to the :negro worker. but a -service to .the white employer. -because !it served to make the negro more efficient and -more industrious and -more anxious to rendertie best service.
660243507|Will the :gentleman from Tennessee yield?
660243508|I will.
660243509|I would like to ask the .gentleman from :Tennessee if there is a corresponding bureau -for -white economics.?
660243510|Oh. the .whole .departnent is .devoted.to that.
660243511|It is -.white .and negro.:togetier. :It is :not .exclusively white.
660243512|of Tennessee. .t was ithe contention that. -although it was.a.small.appropriation..it was a special recognition .of the -negro .worker.
660243513|Will the gentleman -yield.?
660243514|I .yield .first .-tothegentlenan from Delaware.
660243515|Aside from -prejudices of all sorts. :tie question of the millions of thatrace that are in our.country. the fact -6879 that they are here and a part of our body politic seems to me to be a good argument why we should do something to improve their condition. because. as a matter of fact. from the standpoint of economics they are a very Important factor even in the gentlenmans own State.
660243516|The gentleman is correct. And tbis appropriation Is very small and would simply provide for a very limited force here in the District of Columbia.
660243517|The gentleman from Tennessee knows that every dollar that is appropriated by this Government for economics or under that head is appropriated for every colored man just as well as for every white man.
660243518|That is true.
660243519|They~.are not segregated. And the gentleman will further agree with me. I believe. when I say that if you keep these directors of negro economics out of Tennessee and out of Texas and out of Mississippi. the Negro race will be a great deal better off. and theywill have a great deal more friendship exhibited to them by the white people.
660243520|That may be entirely true. but I do not think the record will sustain the gentleman in his contention that any such disturbance as he refers to in Texas is brought about by this service.
660243521|There is nothing in Texas along the line the gentleman from Texas has referred to. but there is the disturbance caused by bringing in these men from New York and elsewhere. to teach different doctrines and who are not under the department of economics at all. Nothigg of the former kind has happened in my district.
660243522|Oh. yes. I can show the gentleman articles from one of the Denison papers and letters from Texas that set forth that state of affairs exactly..
660243523|Mr. Chairman. I think these three provisions. commencing on line 8. page 162. ending with line 9 on page 163. fall within the same class concerning which the House. as I recall. has on former occasions had a decision. The first ruling was on the provision providing for the Employment Service. and the ruling was made by the then presiding Chairman of the committee. the gentleman from Tennessee . in which he held that the Employment Service was not.within the contemplation of the provisions of the act creating the department. Subsequently the committee followed the ruling with regard to that when the bill was again considered. I have not examined closely into that ruling. The House having twice acted upon the matter. I am not inclined to urge the reversal of that ruling. especially in view of the matter that provision can be made without it.
660243524|Mr. Chairman. the present Chairman a moment ago overruled the decision of a former Chairman at this session concerning the Holman rule. and it may be that the present Chairman might have a very different opinion concerning the proposition involved here from that of the Chairman who ruled upon the subject before. The general language of the law creating the Department of Labor and defining in a way. at least. the purpose of the department. Is sufficiently broad in its very comprehensive terms to include all these items in the bill and a thousand more. When the matter was up on the question of the ruling in reference to the Employment Bureau before. it was the ruling of the Chair. practically. at least. that this general language in the beginning of the law creating the department was not a stifficient foundation upon which tc predicate by an appropriation act the creation of new divisions or bureaus in the Department of Labor not otherwise provided for by legislation. 4nd it was a close question. I am not going to argue it with the Chair whether it ought to be ruled one way or the other. but if the Chair happens to be familiar Wlth the proposition. happens to enteitain a different view with reference to the organic act of the department. I think it is perfectly proper for the Chair to express that view and follow it.
660243525|Mr. Chairman. will the Chair hear on word further from me?
660243526|The Chair will hear the gentleman.
660243527|I call the attention of the Chair to the rul that has been expressed by the Speaker of the House on variou occasions. that where a ruling has been made in the committee unless there is some very great and good reason why that rub should be changed. the Speaker should follow it.in the House This precedent. made by Chairman GARRETT. which has beet cited by the Chairman of this committee. has been followed sustaining this point of order to just such items made on tw different occasions in this Congress in the committee. th Speaker upholding it after we got back into the House. I think under the circumstances.. this Chairman not. having any ver: great reason for changing the rule twice. expressed by th Committee of the Whole aitd twice followed by the House wil not see fit to change it at this time.
660243528|The Chair is ready to rule. The provision *of law creating the Department of Labor. and bringing within. the Department of Labor the activities of -the Government. which previously affected the relations between employers and employees particularly. and labor in general. are very broad. If the provision now under consideration is construed in such a way as to authorize the creation of a new bureau in the departmnent. the Chair is of the opinion that the paragraph is not: in order. The Chair thinks the paragraph is susceptible of this construction. The Chair is .uclined to think that the language of the paragraplr under consideration goes somewhat beyond the authority which is granted In the act creating the Department of Labor. and in view of the further fact that the matter has been held not to be in order. as the Chair understands. upon previous occasions. the Chair feels constrained to sustain the point of order. The Clerk will read:
660243529|Mr. Chairman. I make a point of order against the paragraph. It is new legislation upon an appropriation bill. and unauthorized by law.
660243530|For the reason given in the preceding decision of the Chair. the Chair sustains the point of order.
660243531|Mr. Chairman. I move to strike out the last word.
660243532|The Chair will state to the gentleman from Texas that. the paragraph having been stricken out. there is nothing upon which to base his pro forum amendment. The Clerk will read.
660243533|Mr. Chairman. I move to strike out the last word.
660243534|The gentleman from Texas ioves to strike out the last word.
