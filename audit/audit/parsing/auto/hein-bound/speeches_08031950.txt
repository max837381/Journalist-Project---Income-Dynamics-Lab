810287709|Mr. Speaker. I move that the House resolve itself into the Committee of the Whole House on the State of the Union for the further consideration of the bill to establish a system of priorities and allocations for materials and facilities. authorize the requisitioning thereof. provide financial assistance for expansion of productive capacity and supply. strengthen controls over credit. regulate speculation on commodity exchanges. and by these measures facilitate the production of goods and services necessary for the national security. and for other purposes.
810287710|When the Committee rose on yesterday there was pending the amendment offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania . and a substitute offered by the gentleman from Kentucky . Are there any further amendments at this time?
810287711|Mr. Chairman. a parliamentary inquiry.
810287712|The gentleman will state it.
810287713|Mr. Chairman. as the Chairman has stated. the parliamentary situation as I understand is that the gentleman from Pennsylvania has submitted an amendment to the committee bill. the gentleman from Kentucky has submitted a substitute. The parliamentary inquiry is along this line: How many amendments may be pending to either the Kunkel amendment or the Spence substitute?
810287714|Only one amendment to either the Kunkel amendment or the Spence substitute may be pending at one time. and that amendment must be disposed of before another amendment may be offered. The number of amendments Is limited in that way.
810287715|If an amendment be offered to the Spence substitute would an amendment to that amendment be in order?
810287716|It would not.
810287717|Is the same thing. true of amendments to the Kunkel amendment?
810287718|Exactly.
810287719|Mr. Chairman. a parliamentary inquiry.
810287720|The gentleman will state it.
810287721|If one wishes to offer an amendment to the Spence substitute must one wait until the Kunkel amendment is voted up or down?
810287722|No. the amendment can be offered at any time the Member is recognized by the Chair.
810287723|Mr. Chairman. a parliamentary inquiry.
810287724|The gentleman will state it.
810287725|Suppose an amendment be offered to the original committee bill that was reported. does that take precedence over an amendment to the substitute?
810287726|Only one section of the original bill has been read. and only that part is subject to amendment at this time.
810287727|Mr. Chairman. a further parliamentary inquiry.
810287728|The gentleman will state it.
810287729|Do we understand that an amendment is in order to any section of the Kunkel amendment or to any section of the substitute?
810287730|That is true.
810287731|Mr. Chairman. I offer an amendment.
810287732|"Mr. Chairman. it is my intention if this amendment is approved to offer an exactly similar amendment to the Kunkel substitute which also defines as the base period for a ceiling price on agricultural commodities. which is what my amendment refers to. the period from June 10 to June 24. 1950. My amendment seeks to change that provision of the Spence substitute which sets the June 15. 1950. price received by producers. as that on which a ceiling price for agricultural commodities is to be determined. There is a standard in the Spence substitute which my amendment does not disturb and which says that the cejling price shall be ""the parity price for such commodity."" then it goes on and says ""or the average price received by the producers on June 15. 1950. if that is higher."" I am making that date April 15. 1950. by my amendment. This is the reason for it: We discussed the question on yesterday and it appeared very clear that whereas in other items of industrial equipment and of consumer goods there may have been serious rises in prices beginning with the Korean episode on June 25. 1950. in the case of agricultural commodities a sensational rise had begun on April 1. 1950. I would like to give the House some figures as follows: E Average price Perand ect received by centago ive farmers of Commodity and parity _ parity unit I price. price. June 15 Apr 15 June 15. June 15. 19501 1950 19501 1950 Soybeans. per bushel- 2.55 2.48 2.80 110 Lemons. per box 2... 3.14 1.53 3.79 121 Beef cattle. per hundredweight -------- 17. 30 21. 80 23. 70 137 Veal calves. per hundredweight --...... 19. 40 24.60 25. E0 134 Lambs. per hundredweight ---------- 19. 10 23.80 24.80 130 Wool. per pound -.... 51.3 0. 4 56. 2 110 1 Source: Agriculture Prices issued by Bureau of Agricultural Economics. U. S. Department of Agriculture. June 30. 1950. 2 Equivalent ontree returns for all methods of sale. Yesterday when we discussed this question it was made very clear that all of us who represented the agricultural districts and all of us who represented city districts would try to be fair about this situation. we would not try to tax the respective people whom we represent unduly. It appears now that on June 15. 1950. which is the date set up in the Spence substitute. the market price was in certain agricultural commodities very considerably higher than the parity price. That was the case primarily in meat. These figures extracted from those I have given above are very interesting. On beef cattle the market price was 137 percent of the parity price on June 15. on veal calves 134 percent. on lambs 130 percent and on wool 110 percent. In other words. in these principal items of meat the market price was onethird higher than the parity price. What is the parity price? The parity price is the relationship between the cost of what the farmer buys and what the farmer gets for what he sells. Not only that but the parity price by the last Agricultural Adjustment Act was adjusted so that it is now far more modern. It is what is called modern parity and takes in the years from 1939 to 1949. hence it takes into consideration the much higher prices which obtained during World War II. so that if you give the farmer 100 percent of parity you will not be unfair to him. you would be compensating him fully for all his increased costs. I point out that parity price is very different from the support price. which is what is maintained under the Agricultural Adjustment Act and which may range between 60 and 90 percent of the parity price. Under the Spence substitute there is parity price. not 60 to 90 percent. but the full parity price or the market price on June 15. 1950. whichever is higher. In view of these sensational rises in a few commodities. but very key commodities because meat constitutes about 25 percent of the average moderate families budget. I submit. in view of the sensational rise from April 1 to June 15. through the Korean episode. of these particular food prices. if there is to be a rollback the fair date to choose for these commodities is April 15. The reason I do not use April 1 is because the Bureau of Agricultural Economics gets out a record of Agricultural Prices on the fifteenth of the month. I have it before me. April 15 is the date upon which they have found and definitely ascertained what the market prices are. and I have chosen that date."
810287733|Mr. Chairman. will the gentleman yield?
810287734|I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania.
810287735|What percentage of increase would take place from the date the gentleman suggests to the date that is now in the bill?
810287736|It runs from about 20 to 25 percent.
810287737|The time of the gentleman from New York has expired.
810287738|Mr. Chairman. I ask unanimous consent to proceed for two additional minutes.
810287739|Is there objection to the reqdest of the gentleman from New York?
810287740|Between April 15 and June 15 the increase was about twothirds of the total increase over parity.
810287741|Mr. Chairman. will the gentleman yield?
810287742|I yield to the gentleman from Iowa.
810287743|The gentleman has given us parity prices for meat products. Should not the gentleman also give us parity prices for corn. wheat. and all the rest of the products for the same date?
810287744|May I point out to my colleague that in those commodities I have not included in my figures. the parity prices were higher than the market prices. hence they are not germane to this discussion as the bill even after my amendment will still retain the parityprice standard as to those commodities. My amendment leaves in the bill the ceiling of parity prices. so where the parity price is higher than the market price. there is no complaint.
810287745|Does not the gentleman think it fair to apply that to meat products?
810287746|In effect my amendment does that. because the market price was higher as to meat. than the parity price. I made that clear in my statement to the House.
810287747|Mr. Chairman. will the gentleman yield?
810287748|I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania.
810287749|Does the gentlemans amendment also roll back wages?
810287750|That is determined in another part of the bill at the period between May 24 and June 24. 1950. In view of the fact that there is no comparable situation in wages or in other prices during the period between April 15 and May 24. I have confined my amendment to the particular items which moderateincome people buy and in which there was a sensational rise in that period.
810287751|Can the gentleman give us a specific answer as to whether or not his amendment does roll back wages?
810287752|I have just given the gentleman that language. My amendment deals only with agricultural products. for the reasons stated. because that is the case in which the shoe hurts.
810287753|Mr. Chairman. will the gentleman yield?
810287754|I yield to the gentleman from New Mexico.
810287755|Under what theory does the gentleman believe he should pick out a certain commodity and go back and roll it back to April. except convenience? This is a war measure. and ought to treat everybody alike.
810287756|I have already made that clear and I would like to point out that my colleague the gentleman from Georgia yesterday said that this provision ought to be reviewed. I hope the House will review it now.
810287757|Mr. Chairman. I rise in opposition to the amendment. Mr. Chairman. the amendment offered by the gentleman from New York would have the effect of depressing the prices of agricultural commodities. We have attempted to enact a bill that will provide for a stable economy. and that there be a just relationship between the price of commodities and the wages of labor. The gentleman from New York selects April 15 as the date to fix the comparable prices of agricultural commodities. That would have the effect of lowering the prices of those commodities and of dislocating their relationship to the other prices and the wages of labor. It seems to me it would be inadvisable to pass legislation of that kind. I do not have the statistics. I do not know just what effect it would have. no consideration has been given to it in committee. and it is of farreaching import. And. I want to say another thing. I come from the city. but if we do not give the farmer a price that will persuade him to stay on the farm and produce. the prices of commodities that he produces will necessarily rise. It is essential the farmer shall obtain a fair price for his product. I hope the amendment will be defeated.
810287758|Mr. Chairman. will the gentleman yield?
810287759|I yield to the gentleman from New York.
810287760|"The gentleman from Georgia said yesterday when we discussed that very question about fairness to the farmer. which is very important. and I know that my colleague here is going to enlighten us on that score. and I welcome him. and I emphasize that: All we want to be is fair. We want to be very fair about this. The gentleman from Georgia said. ""I agree with the gentleman that there was a rise there""-I am quoting his words in respect to farm products-""but It was from the processor and wholesaler on down through the retailer to the consumer."" He said the farmer has sold his crops. so the farmer is not interested now. We are dealing with speculators. and that is exactly what this amendment is designed to do."
810287761|I think It goes very much further than that. I think we do not know just what effect it would have. but I know that it will have the effect of reducing prices.
810287762|Mr. Chairman. will the gentleman yield?
810287763|I yield to the gentleman from Kansas.
810287764|I should like to comment on the statement made by the gentleman from New York to the effect that farmers had sold their crops and would not be affected by this rollback. He says that his amendment would apply specifically to meat animals. Meat animals are sold every day in the year. so farmers have not disposed of their meat animals. They sold them on the 16th of April. they sold them on the 30th of April. they are selling them today. and they will sell them tomorrow. So what the gentleman just said has no point whatever.
810287765|I think it is obvious that we have not had sufficient consideration of the amendment. I hope it will be voted down.
810287766|Mr. Chairman. I move to strike out the last word. Mr. Chairman. if there has been one thing that has come out of the Korean situation it is justification for the bold and courageous stand taken by Admiral Louis E. Denfeld when he testified last year as to this countrys lack of preparedness. It is now clear that he is the Billy Mitchell of this period because he sacrificed his career to warn America that it was in danger. Had his advice been heeded. we would have had from the very outset of this Korean crisis an effective striking force of carrierbased planes and Marines to throw into Korea. To correct the badly shattered confidence of our people. I believe that the Armed Services Committee of the House of Representatives should request General Eisenhower. Admiral Denfeld. General Spaatz. Admiral Halsey. and some others to give us the benefit of. any suggestioi.s they may care to make. God save the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. No one could contribute more than Admiral Louis E. Denfeld. America needs men of his character. courage. and ability.
810287767|Mr. Chairman. I rise in opposition to the amendment. Mr. Chairman. I hope I will be pardoned for saying. as we begin our deliberations on these amendments. that I hope everybody will make an effort to try to treat all groups as nearly as possible alike. I regret that the legislative situation is such that I cannot offer the amendment which I gave notice yesterday I would offer on this question. The gentleman seeks to go back to April 15 as the determining price. the market price on commodities. in fixing the ceiling prices when they should be above the parity price. I said yesterday that I intend to ask the House to strike the one date fixed in the Spence amendment on agricultural commodities. June 15. and write In exactly the same provision as is provided here for the wage earner. It says here that the wage earners ceiling shall not be less than the highest wage in the period from May 24 to June 24. That is all right with me. That includes the miners increase after April 15. Many of these new automobile contracts were made after April 15. They will all be protected by the May 24 to June 24 provision. I ask the gentleman from New York to reconsider his statement that there were no substantial increases in wages after April 15. because there were. and I think the farmers of the Nation. as I understand them and know them. do not intend to ask you to roll back those wage increases which were received up until the time of the Korean conflict. All the farmers of the Nation are asking is that you give them exactly equal treatment. that the highest price during the same 30day period. from May 24 to June 24. be considered one of the minimums for their prices. If the gentleman is concerned about the prices of meat. and I know he is concerned about that. then perhaps we may have to deal with that problem separately. I do not at the moment however see the need for that. but certainly when the gentleman offers an amendment which treats with the whole agricultural structure across the board predicated only upon the prices of one or two commodities. I doubt the soundness of such an approach.
810287768|Mr. Chairman. will the gentleman yield?
810287769|I yield.
810287770|There are two reasons for my amendment. First. it is the fact that parity remains in the bill.
810287771|Yes. indeed.
810287772|Hence practically every commodity is protected except that those that have had these inordinate rises. Secondly. and very important. wages are not in the same position as farm prices. Wages do not have parity prices. and the Government has not spent $4.000.000.000 to protect them. However. I am not mad about that. And I am not arguing against it. At this point I only point out that it is right to treat the agricultural situation on its own because i. does occupy a unique position in respect to the price situation.
810287773|I have great respect for the gentleman. but I regfet I cannot agree with him. I see no more reason why we should roll back farm prices as long as they are reasonable than it would be to roll back wages. If we are going to start this morning with a general rollback plan and are going to use the Korean conflict as the justification for this legislation. and this bill would not be here otherwise. then let us fix that date.
810287774|Mr. Chairman. will the gentleman yield?
810287775|I yield.
810287776|The speaker has fully demonstrated the fallacy of undertaking to write a bill on the floor of the House of this nature. without any hearings whatever. The House is trying to write a bill to control every commodity in the United States where the interrelationship of all commodities is so complicated and complex. If we have to have a control bill. let us have a meeting right away. The chairman has said that he will call a meeting next week for the purpose of haviig hearings on a control bill. Let us hold a committee meeting so that we can put all these bills together and so that the committee can hear witnesses on these problems. The fallacy of going about this on the floor of the House is revealed when the gentleman from New York who knows nothing on earth about agriculture gets up and tries to write a bill here for agriculture. You could put all the acreage you ever heard of in New York City in a quarteracre lot. and yet we have a situation here which permits the gentleman from New York to get up and try to write a bill here for agriculture in this country.
810287777|The time of the gentleman from Georgia has expired.
810287778|Mr. Chairman. I ask unanimous consent to proceed for an additional minute.
810287779|Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Georgia?
810287780|I simply want to add this in conclusion: As far as my part in this is concerned. I intend the best I know how to treat those who work in the plants and in the factories and those who work in the sun in the fields exactly alike. They are both entitled to our most sympathetic consideration. I beg you to not start this morning creating rank discrimination between the two groups. The wage earner gets his wages from the factory. and the farmer gets his wages from the commodities he produces and sells in the market place.
810287781|"Mr. Chairman. will the gentleman yield? Mr. H. CARL ANDERSEN. In just a moment. If you want to put the entire beef and pork supply into the black market. just accept such an amendment as this. Certainly our memory is not so short that we cannot go back to 1942. when our Government said to the farmers. ""You can get only 72 cents for your butterfat."" ""You can get 55 cents from the creamery. and you are entitled to a subsidy of 17 cents. and that is all you can get. even though the market value of butterfat uncontrolled would have approached $1 a pound."" What happened? Four neighbors of mine did away with their dairy herds as did thousands of other dairy farmers. Production in our Nation was at a minimum. and as soon as the OPA went off butter skyrocketed to over $1 a pound. temporarily. The only answer to the sufficiency of meat or butter for the people in the gentlemans district in New York is production. If you start to monkey with our entire economic structure. you will create havoc all through the Nation. Let us not discourage production of any food. because it is only through profit incentive will farmers endure the drudgery of feeding the rest of the Nation. Keep this in mind also: If meat goes into the blackmarket channels. where will you get the insulin for the diabetics of the Nation? Where are you going to get all of these new drugs that we hear so much about today? The cattle that are slaughtered out in the woods for the black market do not produce the essentials of these miracle drugs which offer so much to those afflicted by certain ailments. So I plead with the House to turn down this amendment most emphatically."
810287782|Mr. Chairman. will the gentleman yield? Mr. H. CARL ANDERSEN. I yield.
810287783|I appreciate what the gentleman has said. The Members of this House know that the able. conscientious gentleman from Minnesota understands more about actual farming problems confronting our farmers. than any other Member in this House. He is a real dirt farmer himself and always keeps his feet on the ground. as we say out West. The gentleman knows that while the farmer is the greatest producer of raw materials. he is also our greatest consumer of goods. The farmer consumes one and onehalf times more. per capita. than do the rest of the people of America. due to the fact that the farmer is by far the best customer of durable manufactured goods. such as farm machinery. lumber. fencing. and clothing. Mr. H. CARL ANDERSEN. I appreciate very much the remarks of the gentleman from Iowa. Agriculture is the best customer of the manufacturers in the United States and provides a tremendous number of jobs throughout the Nation in the handling of what we raise for the consumer. I cannot see the attitude of some of these gentlemen from the industrial East who will not recognize the fact that unless you give to agriculture a little profit. industry itself will never prosper. nor will the working people of the United States receive decent wages.
810287784|Is it not also a fact that between April 15 and June 15. because of the rise in farm products. a number of the people in Mr. JAVITS district and all over America were able to go back to work because of the buying power of the American farmer. Government records prove that every dollar of farm income generates over $4 in wages for the American worker. Mr. H. CARL ANDERSEN. The gentleman is absolutely correct. I cannot see the attitude of some of these gentlemen from the industrial East who will not recognize the fact that unless you give to agriculture a little profit. industry itself will never prosper. nor will the working people of the United States receive decent wages.
810287785|Mr. Chairman. will the gentleman yield? Mr. H. CARL ANDERSEN. I yield.
810287786|"The purchase price on June 15 was $17.30 per hundredweight for cattle. - The price I want to set on April 15 was $4 more. or $21.80. Mr. H. CARL ANDERSEN. Just a minute. I do not yield further. The gentleman talks about parity price. The gentleman does not realize that the farmer has taken a jolt that no other line of industry has taken since 1947. Today I am selling barley off my farm for which I may obtain $1.35. The same grade barley in 1947 returned me $2.50. or in other words it is 40 percent less today. The same thing applies to rye. I am lucky if I get $3.75 for flax. whereas I got $7 in 1947. Eggs are only about 60 percent of parity. but let us take a glance at what we must buy. Just today my farm foreman telephoned me about the purchase of a new wagon. I said. ""How much is it?"" He said. ""$350. equipped with tires."" I said. ""If we must have it. we have to pay the price."" But 3 years ago I could have bought that same wagon for $225. Farm machinery generally because of increases in freight cost and labor costs have all advanced materially since 1945."
810287787|The time of the gentleman from Minnesota has expired.
810287788|Is there objection?
810287789|Mr. Chairman. will the gentleman yield? Mr. H. CARL ANDERSEN. I yield to the gentleman from Kansas. who is as conversant with our farming problems as anyone in Government.
810287790|Is not the proposal of the gentleman from New York in selecting a special date upon which to roll back farm prices eminently unfair unless he also selects the same date for rolling back the prices of the things the farmer buys? Mr. H. CARL ANDERSEN. That would be the fair thing to do. All of us want to do the right thing by the various segments of this great country of ours. We on the farms must have an adequate Income. otherwise we cannot provide the food for the people of New York and the industrial East. Everything farmers buy today costs far more than in 1939. We all know that.
810287791|Mr. Chairman. will the gentleman yield? Mr. H. CARL ANDERSEN. I am glad to yield to the gentleman from Iowa who these 12 years in Congress has fought consistently for agriculture. No man in Congress has done more than has the gentleman from Iowa in awakening the people to the great need for soil conservation in America.
810287792|Is it not a fact that approximately 80 percent of the initial cost of every manufactured article on an average is paid out for wages. so it Is an idle gesture and of no use whatever to attempt to control prices without also controlling wages? Mr. H. CARL ANDERSEN. Eightytwo percent is the correct figure. I believe. When I buy that wagon for $350. labor. somewhere along the line receives about $270 in manufacturing wheels. tires. lumber. steel box. and freight. coal. and what have you.
810287793|Mr. Chairman. will the gentleman yield for a question? Mr. H. CARL ANDERSEN. I yield to my good friend from New York. whose only fault is his ardent desire for too cheap food for his constituents.
810287794|May I ask the gentleman whether he does not feel it is right that we in the city should at long last begin to argue about these very things we are discussing here as to whether we are right or not? Mr. H. CARL ANDERSEN. I cannot feel too sorry for your consumers. because it is a known fact that in the last few years they have been paying a smaller percentage of their income for food than they paid in former years prior to World War II.
810287795|The consumer certainly does not think so.
810287796|Mr. Chairman. I rise in opposition to the pro forma amendment. Mr. Chairman. here we see the trouble we get into when we start trying to discuss the rollback proposition as of a certain date. using one date for one thing and another date for another. I regret that I have to oppose the amendment offered by the gentleman from New York. I feel that the amendment offered by the gentleman from Georgia is the only workable way that we can handle this thing. I am going to admit right now that it gives the farmer certain advantages. I think we have got to admit that. but here is the part that has me stopped: Even with the freeze of wages and agricultural prices as of a certain date. and other dates for other commodities. the less rollback period there is involved the better chance you have of making this stabilization measure work. Let me say further that even after we pass this. unless the standby provisions are immediately initiated you are going to have inequities continue to arise. you are going to continue to have maladjustments in its operation because of the inflationary pressure and because of the fact that people are going to think of that ageold law. selfpreservation. to take care of No. 1. they are going to withhold from the market. they are going to indulge in panic buying. they are going to hoard inventories and all that sort of thing. So for the moment I say that the amendment to be offered by the gentleman from Georgia must be accepted notwithstanding the fact that it gives to the agricultural people a certain advantage. You have got to recognize that inequities are going to become part of the law regardless of what period you take. and the latest period you take is the best period. and the period for wages and agricultural prices must be identical. in other words. it must bear with the same weight on labor as it does on agricultural commodities. Let us put this bill into effect as fairly as possible by preserving the status quo as of the freeze period just as quickly as possible. Let us not go back any further than we have to go back. because as we go back we enlarge the likelihood of additional inequities.
810287797|Mr. Chairman. will the gentleman yield?
810287798|I yield.
810287799|The gentleman Is referring to the amendment to be offered by the gentleman from Georgia . is that not correct?
810287800|Yes. and it is my understanding that it will use exactly the same period for agricultural production as is used for wages. and I rise in support of that. although I do not have a single farmer in my district. I recognize the equity of the amendment from the standpoint of practical administration.
810287801|Mr. Chairman. will the gentleman yield?
810287802|I yield to the gentleman from Indiana.
