660216249|The gentleman from Iowa offers an. amendment. Which the Clerk -Will report.
660216250|The question is on agreeing to the amendment.
660216251|"Mr. Chairman. I offer another amendment. that between the quotation marks and the word ""Printing"" insert the figures ""567."""
660216252|The gentleman. from Iowa offers an amendment. which the Clerk will report.
660216253|The question is on agreeing to the amendment.
660216254|Tlie question is on agreeing to the committee amendment.
660216255|I would like to ask the gentleman having this measure in charge the reason which prompted the committee to ieduce this term? Does he think that any benefit will be derived during this short time of one year?
660216256|I will say to the gentleman that it was upon my motion this time was reduced- The reason I had for offering this amendment was that I did npt want to do anything in any way which would tend to discourage the creation of new mills. which I believe to be the only way in which paper prices will ever be reduced. I think this country. at least in Alaska and in certain parts of Washington. is admirably adapted for the production of paper pulp and paper. itself.. and it is my great desire that some new mills be erected. I believe if this period was made two years it might. perhaps. have some tendency to develop the establishment of new mills. whereas if it was fixed at one year. and at the end of the year it was necessary to continue it. it would be necessary to continue it for another year or two years. as the case might be.
660216257|If the gentleman will permit. it takes three years to establish a mill. Now. the time having been reduced. to one year. with the gentlemans statement that it would be easy to extend it another year or another two years. might not that very possibility. that the term is now made. so short that it will probably have to be extended. also result in deterring interests from entering upon the construction of mills?
660216258|I hardly think so. And my friend from Oregon . at my right. suggests also another matter .fthat was taken into consideration by the committee. that it was possible in some instancos to somewhat extend the capacity of the mills. not withh. a very brief time. but possibly within d year and a half or so. and if possible w wanted to encourage such extension of the mills. At this particular time there is a large mill under construction. I understand. in the State of Washington. Just how near it is to completion I can not say. but my recollection is that the gentleman from Washington said it would be completed in about a year.
660216259|I understaid ie is substantially completed now and will be ready for operation in the near future. I have not seen the mill for a good while. But that is the first unit. and other units are in contemplation.
660216260|Do I understand that unless these mills are permitted to get the exorbitant pices for print paper they are not going tostart in constructing them in the future?
660216261|"No. but this raises the limitation so that the tariff would not apply except in case there was an exorbitant price. For that reason I thought it was Well.to""limit the time."
660216262|Mr. Chairman. I do not feel at all confident that this bill will have any practical. effect upon the newspaper situation. Paper coming from Canada is now absorbed. all that the Canadian Government will permit to be exported. and I think there is ho paper coming in that costs now so much as 5 cents a pound. It may have a tendency to keep the price down in future contracts. There has been some hope that with the high prices of paper in this country there might come a considerable trade with Scandinavian countries. where they have a cheap process of manufacturing paper. with the wood at hand and the water power at hand. I doubt very much whether you will be able to build up much of a trade in paper with the Scandinavian countries with the provision that youi nly invite such trade for one year. While paper is not a commodity that is accumulatedit is used from day to day. and newspapers live from hand to mouth so far as paper is concerned. because -it takes up so much rooi for storage that it can not afford usually to store itstill the paper is usually disposed of in advance: Because of its bulky nature printpaper manufacturers never manufacture supplies largely in advance They may. have a considerable supply. but the storage of paper amounts to so much that as a rule it is not made in large quantities unless they know where they are going to sell it. We are inviting Scandinavian paper mills to send us paper because we have- a large shortage just now. but we hid only extending this invitation so far as this bill is concerned for one year. and I do not think that the invitation wil. be very gener ally accepted. People do not start out with new lines of trade on the- assumption that if they build up trade it is going to be cut off at the end of a: year. It will not be done by the Scandinavian mfianufacturers. it would not be done by American manufacturers. it would not be done by anybody who had common sense. aid common sense rules to a large extent the tfade of the *oild. While It looks well and sounds fine. it diccomplishds nothing.
660216263|The question is on agreeing to the com mittee amendment. The question was. taken. and the Chair announced that the noes seeiied to have It.
660216264|Division. Mr. Chalrmai. The committee divided. and therewereayes. 44. noes 27. • So the amendment was agreed to.
660216265|Mr. Chairman. I move to strike out the last word. for the purpose ofaskfng the gentleman from Iowa a. question.
660216266|The gentleman from Massachusetts moves to strike out the last word.
660216267|"Wliat is. going to. be the effect of this legislation at the end of one year? Section 2 says that ""this it shall expire by limitation nat the end of oneyear from the date of its passdge"" and section 600 shall become oporative in. its steadNow. section 600 is still operative. This act will continue. It In operation. and its operation has not been suspended. Section 600 is amended by this act. but its operation is t6 cohtinue6 in effect. aid section 2 of this bill says that it shall hgaih be come operative. I wanted to get the gentlemans idea of What the effect Would be at the end of the oneyear period."
660216268|The gentleman suggests a matter that I think might. perhaps. be mended by a further amendmont. It Was not expected. I will say. that this bill should come up today at all. I did not draw the bill in the first instance and did not report the bill myself. and while I had noticed some other things that needed to be corrected in it and had prepared some amendments to that end I did not notice what the gentleman from Massachusetts has just called my attention to. I would MAClH-. 30. suggest. 1s the gentleman. from Massachusetts sees the purpose of section 2. that. perhaps. he can suggest an amendment to cover lils objection. ...
660216269|Mr. Chairman. will the gentleman yield?
660216270|ot Iowa. Yes.
660216271|of \\Vest Virginia. As a matter of fact. will it not just go back and reduce from the 8cent to the 5cent limit. and we shall go ahead under the 5cent liuitation? That Will be the effect.
660216272|Mr. Chairman. will the gentleman yield?
660216273|Yes. I yield to tile geintleman from Iowa.
660216274|"How would this answer the purpose: After the word ""purposes"" insert "" as it read and existed prior to the amendment made by section 1. hereof""?"
660216275|"Or ""prior to the. passage of this act."""
660216276|"Yes. or ""prior to the passage of this act."" That would be better. Why would not that answer the pur.pose? ""As it read and was enforced"" would probably be better than"" as.it existed."""
660216277|"Mr. Chairman. I offer an amendment to page. 3. line 4. - After the word "" purposes insert the words. ""in effect prior to the passage of this act.""."
660216278|The gentleman from Massachusetts offers an amendment. which the Clerk will report.
660216279|"""As in effect prior to the passage of this act."""
660216280|The question is on agreeing to the amendment.
660216281|Now. ir. Chairman. I move to strike out the last word.
660216282|The gentleman from North Carolina nmoves to strike out the last word.
660216283|Mr. Chairman. I want to congratulate the Republican members of the Comm ittee on Ways and Means. and the Democrats with them. and the Republican membership of the House. for the consideration and the passage 6f.thisbill. In my opinion it is needed to give at least some hope of relief from the distressed condition of the thousands of little country and little city newspapers throughoutthe country. It is almost an emergency. I want to congratulate the Republicanson the fact that whenever the country faces an emergency. it matters not what it is. they resoit to a Democrhtic policy to give relief fromthat emergency. We remember when the great Chicago fire in 1872 s.}yept away millions of property and left tens of thousands of people homeless the Republican Congress rushed to a Democratic policy to give relief to those suffering people by putting building materials on the free list for a period. When the fire at Portland. Me.. had laid waste hundreds of thousands and millions of dollars worth of property and left many thousands of people in distress and in suffering and without shelter. the Republican Congress at once again rushed to a Democratic policy to give those suffering people relief by putting building materials on the free list for a year. .Again. we remember in the great strike of 1902. when the coal cormorants had every man. woman. and child in the country at their mercy. the Republicans. to give relief to a suffering people. again resorted to a Democratic policy and rushed thiough a Republican House and a Republican Senate. with the approval of a Republican President. an act putting coal on the free list. Now. when the little country papers throughout the United States are in the present struggle and distress. the Republican Party in a Republican House. with a Republican Senate. rushes again to a Democratic policy -by passing a free print paper bill to give these newspapers throughout the country relief. Gentlemen. if Democratic policies are so good and so wise and so virtuous in relieving the people in times of emergencies. why in the name of common justice and common sense are they not good and wise and virtuous enough to have all the time. to prevent the people from getting into these emergencies? I repeat. I congratulate the Republicans on this measure.
660216284|Mr. Chairman. may I ask the gentleman from North Carolina a question?
660216285|Certainly..
660216286|Is it Democratic policy to put dyestuffs on the free list?
660216287|Dyestuffs on the free list? Certain dyestuffs. yes. sir. I want. to say. since the gentleman has mentioned it. that there is a dyestuff act on the statute books put there by the Democrats. For 40 or 50 years the Republicans had control ofthe Government. and they never did one single thing to encourage the dyestuff industry in the United- States. and it remained for a Democratic House and a Democratic Senate and a Democratic President in 1916 to put upon the statute books the first encouraging legislation for. the dyestuff industry -in the United States. .The dyestuff bill which the House recently passed followed that Democratic policy. If you had not had that Democratic example to go by. you would not have dared to write a bill. Remember. too. that a dyestuff bill was recommended by a Democratic President in this Congress before you Republicans took a single step.
660216288|Mr. Chairman. .I congratulate my Democratic friend in having seen the light in relation to dyestuffs and putting a Republican tariff on dyestuffs. It is really delightful to see. in some cases at least. the Democrats coming around to sound reasoning in the end.
660216289|If the gentleman will permit. I want to ask him a question. Did not the gentleman vote for the Democratic dyestuff provisions in the Democratic bill in 1916. and did not the gentleman from Ohio with him vote for it. and did not half of the Republicans on the Ways and Means Committee vote for that Democratic bill which I wrote. and did not 50 men on the Republican side of the House vote for that bill in 1916?
660216290|Whenever you. come to the point of adopting protective principles and propose. to put on a protective tariff. we will vote with you every time.
660216291|But a large majority of your party voted against you and. me then. But I recognize the fact that you were more patriotic than a majority of your colleagues. You must admit that the Democratic Party was the first one to put through any legislation in aid of the dyestuff industry. whether you call it a protective tariff or an encouraging tariff or a tariff for revenue with incidental protection.
660216292|Mr. Chairman. I merely desire to suggest to the gentleman from North Carolina that the Democratic Party were forced at last to come to the Republican policy. because they took the rates as provided in the socalled Hill bill and passed that bill. a Republican tariff measure.
660216293|If the gentleman will permit. instead of that being the fact we turned down in committee Mr. Hills bill and the House turned it down. The RECORD will show that Mr. Hill himself got up on this floor and said that the bill which we Democrats proposed. and for which bill Mr. LONGWORTHI1 and ir. GREEN of Iowa voted with me. would not amount to anything. that it would destroy all the dyestuff establishments in this country. and he offered his bill as a substitute. but it was overwhelmingly defeated.
660216294|It is true that I voted for the bill at the same time the gentleman from North Carolina did. but I voted for it because he came more than halfway to me. which is as much as we can possibly expect of a Democrat.
660216295|You Republicans had never gone halfway or any other way on the dyestuff bill. We Democrats went all the Way and passed one.
660216296|Mr. Chairman. I believe I have the floor. The gentleman from North Carolina is a little bit late in his dates. The proposition to put a tariff on dyestuffs was first proposed by the distinguished gentleman from Connecticut. Mr. Hill. and then the Democrats. as usual. came trailing in afterwards when they saw that it was a good proposition. and they established a protective tariff to a certain extent. When they were in control we had to take what we could get. If we could not get what we wanted. we voted for as much protection as we could get.
660216297|"If the gentleman will. just go back to the RECORD and will see the facts. lie will find that the bill for which he and I voted together is as different from the Hill bill as light is from darkness. The gentleman has got it all mi:=ed up in his memory. The gentleman was right then. and I will ask himnot to impeach his record by trying to get out of the right position that he then took. Mr.""GREEN of Iowa. I would rather.trust to the RscoRo than to the vivid imagination of the gentleman from North Carolina. which I have often found to be defective in the phst. Mr. Chairman. I move that the committee do now rise and report the bill to the House with a favorable recommendation."
660216298|I will ask the gentleman to withhold that motion for a homent.
660216299|I yield to the gentleman from Oklahoma.
660216300|I move to strike out section 2.
660216301|The gentleman from Oklahoma offers an amendment. which the Clerk will report.
660216302|Mir. Chairman. if this is good legislation for one year. it is good legislation for two years and it is good legislation indefinitely. It is agreed here that this legislation will not help the big papers. which have made their contracts for the coming year. but that this legislation is in the interest of the small papers.
660216303|Mr. Chairman. just a word on that subject. The conditions that prevail today are .abnormal. They are not likely to exist very long. I hope they will not exist very longnot any considerable term of years. If I thought that the conditions which prevail today were likely to continue indefinitely. I would introduce an altogether different kind of a bill. This is to remedy this special situation. I think the amendment ought to be voted down.
660216304|Tie question is o~n the amendment offered by the gentleman from Oklahoma . The question being taken. on a- division (demanded by Mr. HASTINGS) there wereayes 28. noes 57. Accordingly the amendment was rejected.
660216305|I move that the committee do now rise and report the bill to the House with the amendments. with the recommendation that the amendments be agreed to and that the bill as amended do pass.
660216306|I move the previous question on the bill and amendments to final passage. The previous question was ordered.
660216307|Is a separate vote demanded on any amendment?
660216308|Mr. Speaker. I demand a separate vote on the amendment to section 2. striking out two years and inserting one year in lieu thereof.
660216309|"The gentleman from Illinois demands a separate vote upon the amendment to page 3. line 2. striking out "" two years "" and inserting "" one year."" Is a separate vote demanded on any other amendment? If not. the Chair will put the other amendments in gross. The other amendments were agreed to."
660216310|"The question now comes upon the amendment on which the gentleman from Illinois demands a separate vote. The Clerk will report the amendment. The clerk read as follows: Page 3. line 2. strike out the words two years"" and insert In lieu thereof the words "" one year."" The question being taken. the Speaker pro tempore announced that the noes appeared to haie it."
660216311|Division. Mr. Speaker.
660216312|I nmake the point of order that there is no quorum present.
660216313|"pro temnpore. The gentleman from Illinois nmakes the point of order that there is no quorum present. Evidently there is no quorun present. TheDoorkeeper will close the doors. the Sergeant at Arms will notifyabsentees. As many as favor the amendment will. as their names are called. answer yea."" those opposed "" nay."" and the Clerk will call the roll."
660216314|6f California with Mr. DOREAIUS. The result of the vote was announced as above recorded. The doors were opened.
660216315|The question now is on the engrossriient. andthird reading of the bill. The bill was ordered t6 be engrossed and read a third time. and was read the third time.
660216316|The question is on the passage of the bill.
660216317|On that. Mr. Speaker. I- demand the yeas and nays.
