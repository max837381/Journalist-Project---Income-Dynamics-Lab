810247616|Mr. President. will the Senator yield?
810247617|If the Senator will permit me to complete my statement. I shall then be glad to yield. Everyone who has studied the problems of trade and commerce in our time is aware of the fact that many integrated and agglomerated modern businesses have invaded the field of local retail distribution. Innumerable instances can be cited of the manner in which such organizations have used devious means to crush competition in local markets. They have been known. for example. to sell at a loss in one city or in one area in order to drive out competition. They have been known to impose or to try to impose a rigid price system beneficial to themselves alone and having the effect of stifling the establishment and growth of small or new competitive units. The uniform basingpoint price system and its variations were typical of this sort of monopolistic weapon.
810247618|Mr. President. will the Senator yield?
810247619|Does the Senator from Wyoming yield to the Senator from Minnesota?
810247620|I yield.
810247621|The language really clarifies and strengthens the law. rather than detracting from or weakening it. Am I correct in that statement?
810247622|Precisely. The Senator from Minnesota is quite correct.
810247623|Last evening. when I propounded a question to the Senator from Wyoming. and when I also propounded a question to the Senator from Maryland [Mr. OCoNoRI. I gained comfort and assurance from both replies that what is proposed by the conference report would actually clarify and strengthen the law. rather than weaken it. in such a way as to make possible unfair trade practices or discriminations. I thank the Senator for yielding to me for that brief comment.
810247624|Mr. President. I have no doubt at all in my mind that that is the fact. I speak as a Member of this body who throughout a rather long service here has given the closest possible attention that time would allow me to the antitrust laws and to the maintenance of a competitive economy. I seek to maintain competition and to keep open the door of opportunity to do business and particularly to do competitive business. I feel in all sincerity that it is essential to do this by a legislative enactment if we are to succeed in expanding the economy of the United States. Mr. President. there are innumerable persons who desire to engage in business. who desire to promote the development of raw materials. who desire to go into the distribution of processed materials. but who are intimidated from investing their funds because of the uncertainties which have been occasioned by the interpretations of this act. Again I say that nothing in this measure. if it is adoptedand I feel confident that it will bewill haie the slightest effect of impeding or obstructing or harassing the local retail distributor. Thus the necessity for applying the general standards of the Clayton Act to every case of price discrimination is recognized and the power of the Federal Trade Commission to act against price discriminations. including freight absorption and delivered pricing. is preserved even when good faith is affirmatively shown when the Commission establishes that the practices. if continued. will contribute in any way to oppression or the growth of monopoly or to the lessening of competition.
810247625|Mr. President. will the Senator from Wyoming yield?
810247626|I shall be very glad to yield to my colleague.
810247627|Mr. President. I wanted to ask the Senator from Wyoming a few questions. but I defer to the Senator from Illinois.
810247628|I thank the Senator.
810247629|Is the Senator from Illinois going to ask the Senator from Wyoming questions. or is he going to make a speech?
810247630|I should like to ask some questions.
810247631|Very well.
810247632|Mr. President. I yield to the Senator from Illinois.
810247633|Mr. President. may I first thank the Senator from Wyoming for at last stating just what the alleged confusion has been in the decisions of the Supreme Court and of the Seventh Circuit Court? *
810247634|"I move to amend the words of the Senator by striking out the words ""at last."" because I explained that. when I introduced the bill."
810247635|I am very grateful to the Senator from Wyoming for pin pointing what the alleged grounds. of confusion are. I take it the alleged grounds are the nineteenth footnote in a decision of the Supreme Court in the Cement case. which appears on page 35 of the supplement: While we hold that the Commissions findings of combination were supported by evidence. that does not mean that existence of a combination is an indispensable ingredient of an unfair method of competition under the Trade Commission Act.
810247636|That language was seized upon by representatives of some of the large concentrated industries in the United States to delude independent competitors into the belief that now. if they individually adopted delivered prices. or if they individually absorbed freight. they would be violating the law. The footnote does not. in my judgment. mean that. But what I judge and what the Senator from Illinois judges. will not control the thinking of the man who. either by himself or with associates. wishes to invest $100.000. or $500.000. or $1.000.000. or some such sum in expanding a business.
810247637|I may say I am delighted the Senator from Wyoming agrees with me that the attempt by the steel industry and the cement industry to make smallbusiness men believe that the independent absorption of freight was illegal was an attempt to delude. The Senator from Wyoming used that phrase. I am delighted the Senator from Wyoming agrees that no such interpretation can be put upon this footnote. thrown in incidentally in the course of a decision.
810247638|That is correct.
810247639|May I ask whether it is necessary for the legislature of the United States to pass a law merely to clear up a misapprehension which may have been more or less deliberately planted in the minds of people by certain interests?
