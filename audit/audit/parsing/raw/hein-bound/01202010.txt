program to find the culprits of these
crimes and to offer a deterrent to nu-
clear terrorism.
The one concern I do have is that the
bill, as amended, coming back from the
Senate does not authorize the appro-
priation of $30 million. I believe that is
important. It is essential that we have
it; but, again, this is a major step for-
ward, so I am pleased to support the
legislation even though I wish that the
$30 million had been included in it.
This bill targets an ongoing threat in
a unique way. It will reinvigorate the
workforce pipeline to guarantee the
Nation a resource of technical experts
in this vital and critical field, and it
will strengthen America's attribution
capabilities.

56, Pt. 1                       335
Again, this is a bipartisan effort. It's
the Homeland    Security  Committee
working with Mr. SCHIFF and the Intel-
ligence Committee. It is important
that we pass this and that we really,
again, send a strong signal of how we
do believe in layered defenses, of how
we realize the need of staying ahead of
the terrorist threat and of doing all we
can to protect the American people in
a way which certainly transcends Re-
publican or Democrat lines or liberal-
conservative lines. It is an issue that
should galvanize all Americans.
So, with that, I strongly urge support
of H.R. 730.
I reserve the balance of my time.
Ms. CLARKE. Madam       Speaker, I
yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from
California (Mr. SCHIFF), the author of
this bill.
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, at the
outset, I want to thank and congratu-
late the Homeland Security Committee
and Chairman THOMPSON. The com-
mittee has taken an important step
forward towards preventing nuclear
terrorism by persevering with this leg-
islation, and I appreciate all of the
hard work that the chairman and staff
have put into it.
I also want to thank other Members
who have contributed greatly to the ef-
fort, one being the ranking member,
PETER KING.
Mr. KING, once again, I thank you for
your leadership in this area.
I want to thank the former chairman
of   the  Emerging    Threats   Sub-
committee, an early supporter, JIM
LANGEVIN; the current chairwoman of
that subcommittee, YVETTE CLARKE; as
well as the ranking member of the sub-
committee, DAN LUNGREN; and in the
last Congress, MICHAEL McCAUL.
The Nuclear Forensics and Attribu-
tion Act will help us fight one of the
most   important  national  security
threats we face, that of nuclear pro-
liferation. Countries around the world
now have access to technology that
was once the realm of the few; and dan-
gerous nuclear materials are, unfortu-
nately, sprinkled around the world.
This is not a new problem. Illicit nu-
clear material has been intercepted in
transit out of the former Soviet Union
many times since the end of the Cold
War, and the material we catch is sure-
ly only a small fraction of the total
amount trafficked.
Last year, Graham Allison wrote in
Newsweek that the only thing that
could keep nuclear bombs out of the
hands of terrorists is a brand-new
science of nuclear forensics. He contin-
ued that the key to a new deterrent is
coming up with some way of tracing
the nuclear material backward from an
explosion in New York City to the re-
actor that forged the fissile material,
even to the mines that yielded the
original uranium ore.
The Nuclear Forensics and Attribu-
tion Act is designed to do just that. It

is aimed at the decision-makers in
North Korea, Pakistan, Iran or else-
where who could sell nuclear material,
as well as the smugglers and corrupt
officials around the world who could
steal it. Those parts of the nuclear net-
work can be deterred by the knowledge
that, if their material is later inter-
cepted, the United States will find out
and will hold them responsible.
This bill expands our ability to deter-
mine the source of nuclear material by
authorizing the National Technical Nu-
clear Forensics Center in the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security. This cen-
ter will coordinate the various agen-
cies, and it will ensure an efficient
combined response when nuclear mate-
rial is intercepted or used, God forbid,
in a weapon. It will also advance the
science of nuclear forensics, bringing
in new radiochemists and physicists to
rejuvenate a rapidly aging workforce
and funding research on new methods
to identify materials. It also takes an
important step toward building the nu-
clear forensic database we will need to
effectively track nuclear material.
The bill asks the President to nego-
tiate agreements with other nations to
share forensic data on their nuclear
materials, both civilian and military.
This effort is vital, and the National
Technical Nuclear Forensics Center
must play a key role in negotiations to
ensure that the data we obtain is the
data we need for quick attribution and
response.
El 1400
Nuclear terrorism is an indistinct
threat of devastating consequence and
therefore difficult to guard against.
But as communications and transpor-
tation revolutions bring us ever closer
to our allies, they bring our enemies
close as well. I believe this bill will
help make sure that our ability to pre-
vent a nuclear terror attack keeps up
with our enemies' ability to attempt
one.
Again, I want to thank the chairman
and ranking member for their leader-
ship and urge all Members to support
the bill.
Mr. KING    of New   York. Madam
Speaker, I would like to close by stat-
ing that all of us realize that a ter-
rorist attack is a nightmare scenario.
The fact that we came so close to the
loss of life on Christmas Day reminded
us dramatically of the dangerous world
in which we live. Those of us from New
York will never forget September 11,
2001. But just think of the ultimate
nightmare scenario, and that would be
a nuclear attack. That is almost be-
yond our imagination. That is why ev-
erything must be done to stop those at-
tacks, and to also have the deterrent,
as Congressman SCHIFF said, the deter-
rent of retaliation against any coun-
try, against any entity, against any in-
dividual, any organization, which was
in any way involved in providing nu-

clear weaponry to be used against the
United States.
I strongly urge the adoption of this
legislation.
I have no further requests for time,
and I yield back the balance of my
time.
Ms. CLARKE. Madam      Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
In closing, I would encourage my col-
leagues to vote "aye" on the pending
question. Doing so will allow this im-
portant homeland security legislation
to be sent to the President's desk for
his signature without delay.
I yield back the balance of my time.
The SPEAKER     pro tempore. The
question is on the motion offered by
the gentlewoman from New York (Ms.
CLARKE) that the House suspend the
rules and concur in the Senate amend-
ment to the bill, H.R. 730.
The question was taken.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being
in the affirmative, the ayes have it.
Ms. CLARKE. Madam Speaker, on
that I demand the yeas and nays.
The yeas and nays were ordered.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 8 of rule XX and the
Chair's prior announcement, further
proceedings on this motion will be
postponed.
