attractive and where continuing political
instability has made law-enforcement
efforts difficult.
This international evidence led me, as
chairman of the Senate Subcommittee
on Criminal Justice with oversight juris-
diction over the Drug Enforcement Ad-
ministration, to pay a personal visit to
the officials in the countries of the east-
ern Mediterranean-Turkey, Greece, and
Italy-which form the way-stations of
the westward flow of Southwest-Asian
heroin and opium. My interviews there
only reinforced what preliminary inves-
tigation had indicated-the massive new
supply of narcotics and other illegal
drugs is heading straight to the Western
nations, through a reconstruction of the
infamous "French Connection" which
was successfully broken by international
cooperation only a few years ago.
Through this new "Sicilian Connec-
tion," named after the Mediterranean
island which seems to be the staging area
for the drugs that end up on American
streets, the flow of drugs into this coun-
try is coordinated-at great profit-by
organized crime networks on both sides
of the Atlantic. Unless we prepare con-
certed action among law enforcement,
social service, and health agencies-both
here and abroad-we may witness an epi-
demic of drug abuse as bad or worse than
that of the early seventies. Such a dis-
aster threatens the safety of every citizen
that walks the streets and the health and
future-indeed, the survival-of every
young American.
In light of this growing drug danger, I
find an article such the one entitled
"Drug Crisis and Strategy" from the New
York times of May 22, 1980, frightening.
This article, written by two experts in
the field of drug abuse and its effects,
especially on young people, substantiates
a glaring problem which my subcommit-
tee investigation had revealed: That we
have failed to develop an effective strat-
egy on every level of government-local,
State, and Federal-to prepare for this
epidemic.
The Subcommittee on Criminal Justice
is presently preparing a report on the
findings of our trip to the eastern Medi-
terranean. In this report we hope to out-

12995

line the seriousness of the problem and
the necessary elements that must be co-
ordinated for an effective response to the
threat. Such action depends not only on
fighting drug abuse at home, but on us-
ing international cooperative efforts to
stem the tide at its source. Until our re-
port can be released, I ask that my col-
leagues consider carefully the points
raised in "Drug Crisis and Strategy." I
ask that the article be printed in the
RECORD.
The article follows:
DRUG CRISIS AND STRATEGY
(By Joyce H. Lowinson and David F. Musto)
The rising volume of heroin entering the
United States and the increasing rate of ad-
diction and narcotics-related deaths among
young people raised serious doubts about the
nation's ability to meet new demands for
treatment.
Both of us come to this concern from a
special and unexpectedly frustrating per-
spective. We serve on the White House Strat-
egy Council on Drug Abuse, whose members
were appointed    by  President Carter in
November 1977. At that time, he expressed
concern about the prevention of drug abuse
and directed us to carry out our statutory
responsibilities. The council is composed of
six person from outside the Government and
seven Federal members: the Secretaries of
State, the Treasury, Defense, Health and
Human Services, and the Attorney General,
Administrator of Veterans Affairs, and the
Director of the Office of Management and
Budget. The Federal members send lower-
ranking officials to the meetings.
Congress established the council to deter-
mine Federal strategy for prevention of drug
abuse and drug trafficking, and to monitor
Federal compliance with the strategy, and to
decide upon modifications based upon ex-
perience and new research.
We regret to say that the council has not
functioned as Congress intended, nor, in-
deed, as it was described to us when we
accepted membership. As public representa-
tives, we are distressed that despite the crisis
in heroin addiction, the council has not met,
in spite of our urgings, since Oct. 3.
Our requests for information that by law
we are entitled to receive have been met in
some instances by delays of years, at other
times with only superficial responses. The
council has working groups and subcommit-
tees about which we are given only the
sketchiest information.
Since November 1977, we have never re-
ceived classified information, although we
cannot understand how we can serve any
supervisory function without it. For exam-
ple, we worry about the growing of opium
poppies in Afghanistan and Pakistan by rebel
tribesmen who apparently are the chief ad-
versaries of the Soviet troops in Afghanistan.
Are we erring in befriending these tribes as
we did in Laos when Air America (chartered
by the Central Intelligence Agency) helped
transport crude opium from certain tribal
areas?
It is our opinion, after two years of pa-
tiently asking for information, requesting
more-frequent meetings, repeatedly seeking
from the White House staff some explanation
of why the council is not functioning as it
should, that the executive branch and Con-
gress should agree either to revise the law
and declare the council an advisory body
that meets at the convenience cf the White
House secretariat or to abolish the council.
altogether. We have grave doubts that the
council can work as Congress and the Pres-
ident originally intended. The council ap-
parently is a facade behind which bureau-
crats alone continue to establish policy. The
public is not well-served by interposing an
impressive-sounding "strategy council" be-
tween Congress and the officials in various

departments who are truly responsible for
developing policy.
In the seven months since the last coun-
cil meeting, the Administration has proposed
cuts o., $40 million in a $160 million national
drug-abuse treatment program and would
require local and state governments to ab-
sorb all the costs of inflation in the remain-
ing programs. There are now, and certainly
will be in the immediate future, thousands
of addicts seeking treatment who cannot be
accommodated.
The heroin crisis is a bipartisan concern.
Recently, Representative Lester L. Wolff, a
Democrat and chairman of the House Select
Committee on Narcotics Abuse and Control,
and State Senator Frank Padavan, a Re-
publican and chairman of the New York
State Senate Committee on Mental Hygiene
and Narcotics Control, have held hearings
at which the treatment quandry has been
documented. According to the New York
State Division of Substance Abuse Services,
in 1979 drug-related deaths in New York
City rose 77 percent.
Heroin entering the United States origi-
nates increasingly from opium produced in
Iran, Afghanistan and Pakistan. On the
streets, this drug is more potent, cheaper and
more available than at any time in the last
20 years. Young teenagers are appearing at
treatment centers. Seizures of heroin have
increased dramatically. Julio Martinez, direc-
tor of the New York State Division of Sub-
stance Abuse Services, warns that this crisis
is bound to worsen.
It is difficult to believe that the need for
treatment can be less in 1980 than in earlier
years. The cost of jailing drug users is far
higher and less effective than the cost of
treatment. It is economically unsound to cut
funds for treatment. We urge reconsideration
of these cuts.e
INDIAN HEALTH CARE AMEND-
MENTS OF 1980
Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. Mr. President,
I ask unanimous consent that the Senate
proceed to consideration of Calendar Or-
der No. 808, S. 2728.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill
will be stated by title.
The legislative clerk read as follows:
A bill (S. 2728) to amend the Indian Health
Care Improvement Act and the Public Health
Service Act with respect to Indian health
care, and for other purposes.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there
objection to the present consideration of
the bill?
Without objection, the Senate pro-
ceeded to consider the bill.
* Mr. MELCHER. Mr. President, the
94th Congress reviewed the state of In-
dian health to find that the health status
of Indians and Alaska Natives was still
far below that of the general population
and that Indian communities and Alaska
Native villages were plagued with health
concerns other American communities
h9,d forgotten 25 years previously. The
94th Congress passed the Indian Health
Care Improvement Act, Public Law 94-
437, to implement the Federal responsi-
bility for the care and education of the
Indian people by improving the services
and facilities of Federal Indian programs
and encouraging maximum participation
of Indians in such programs, and for
other purposes.
The Indian Health Care Improvement
Act established a 7-fiscal-year program,
among other things, to provide scholar-

NGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENA
ships to address the shortage of Indian
health professionals, to provide addi-
tional authorizations for appropriations
to eliminate the backlogs in health serv-
ices and facility construction and reno-
vation, and to authorize resources to es-
tablish health referral or care programs
in urban centers having a sufficient In-
dian   population  with   unmet health
needs. In addition, Public Law 94-437 au-
thorizes medicare and medicaid reim-
bursements for services provided in cer-
tain Health Service and tribally operated
health care facilities.
The Indian Health Care Improvement
Act provides authorizations for appro-
priations for the various programs for
the first 3 fiscal years of the 7-year pro-
gram and provides that appropriations
for fiscal years 1981 through 1984 must
be specifically authorized in an act en-
acted after the Indian Health Care Im-
provement Act. The purpose of S. 2728 is
to amend the Indian Health Care Im-
provement Act and the Public Health
Service Act to provide the authorizations
for fiscal years 1981 through 1984 for the
programs provided in the Indian Health
Care Improvement Act and to make sub-
stantive  amendments to      the  Indian
Health Care Improvement Act to elimi-
nate problems encountered during the
first 3 fiscal years of program operation
under the act.

titled to receive services from an urban In-
dian organization under a contract made
pursuant to this title. Section 507 also pro-
vides authorizations for appropriations for
fiscal years 1981, 1982, 1983, and 1984 to car-
ry out the section.
Section 7(c) amends section 508 to require
a review by the Secretary of the programs
established under this title and submission
to the Congress of his assessment thereof and
recommendations for any further legislative
efforts he deems necessary to meet the pur-
pose of this title, including section 507.
Such report must contain an assessment of
the unmet health needs of the urban In-
dian population and the Indian population
in other nonreservation areas, including the
needs of urban centers not previously served
by an urban Indian organization under a
contract made under this title.
Section 7(d) amends the heading of title
V to read "TITLE V-HEALTH SERVICES
FOR URBAN AND OTHER NONRESERVA-
TION INDIANS".
Section 8:
Section 8(a) amends section 704 to pro-
vide authority for the reconstruction and
renovation by the Secretary of any facility
leased by the Secretary from an Indian tribe.
Section 8(b) amends title VII to add a
new section 706. Such section requires the
Secretary to submit to Congress a resource
allocation plan within one year from the date
of enactment of this section.
Section 8(b) also amends title VII to add
a new section 707. Such section requires the
Secretary to conduct, in conjunction with
other appropriate Federal agencies in con-
sultation with concerned Indian tribes and
organizations, a study of the health hazards
to Indians on or near Indian reservations
and in Indian communities as a result of
nuclear resource development, such study to
be submitted to the Congress no later than
the date eighteen months after the date of
enactment of this section. The section pro-
vides an authorization for appropriations for
the purposes of preparation of the study and
with a requirement that the funds so appro-
priated  must    be  expended    within   the
eighteen-month period from the date of
enactment.
Section 707 further provides for the Sec-
retary and the Service to develop a plan to
address the health problems identified in the
study and submit such plan and a report, in-
cluding recommended activities for imple-
mentation of the plan as well as an evalua-
tion of any activities previously undertaken
by the Service to address such health prob-
lems. The plan and report must be submitted
within one year after the submission of the
study.
Section 707 established an Intergovern-
mental Task F3rce composed of the Secretary
or Administrator of specified Federal agen-
cies to identify existing or potential opera-
tions related to nuclear resource development
that affect or may affect the health of such
Indians, enter into activities to correct ex-
isting health hazards, and insure that cur-
rent and future health problems resulting
from   nuclear development activities are
minimized or reduced.
The section designates a chairman for the
task force and provides a minimum number
of meetings of such task force to be held
each year. The section further provides that
the Service may recover from a mine or mill
operator certain costs of any diagnosis and
treatment rendered to an Indian who is eligi-
ble for health services from the Service, who
by reason of his employment is entitled to
medical care at the expense of his employer,
and who, as a result of employment in a
uranium mine or mill, suffers from a work-
related illness or condition.
Section 8(b) further amends title VII
to add a new section 708. Such section directs
the Service to designate the State of Arizona

NGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE

as a contract health service delivery area and
provides that the Service shall not curtail
any health care services provided to Indians
residing on reservations in the state if such
curtailment is due to provision of contract
services in the state pursuant to such desig-
nation.
S. 2728 provides authorizations for ap-
propriations for fiscal year 1981 totaling
$105,560,000, authorizations for fiscal year
1982 totaling $120,545,000, authorizations for
fiscal year 1983 totaling $138,807,500, and au-
thorizations for fiscal year 1984 totaling
$159,660,000. The group total for fiscal years
1981 through 1984 is $524,572,500.
The Indian Health Service, tribes, and
urban Indian organizations with health proj-
ects have developed tribal and urban specific
health plans to identify the unmet health
needs of these Indian populations.
The plans indicate unmet health needs
as follows:
Health Manpower ------------$293,104,000
Health Services --------------637,798, 000
Health Facilities ------------1,806,996,000
Urban Health -----------    111,403,000
Total Unmet Needs .... 2,849,301,000
Although S. 2728 does not provide au-
thorizations for appropriations which total
the level of documented unmet needs as in-
dicated in the tribal and urban specific
health plans, other resources available will
assist in ameliorating the deficit. For exam-
ple, Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements
pursuant to title IV of the Indian Health
Care Improvement Act are estimated as
follows:
Medicare       Medicaid
Fiscal year 1980-- $8,452,000     $7,637,000
Fiscal year 1981-- 9, 959,000      8, 124,000
Fiscal year 1982-- 10,771,000      8,796,000
Fiscal year 1983-- 11,730,000      9,435,000
Fiscal year 1984-- 12,717,000     10, 103,000
Total ---- 53,629,000      44,095,000
The total estimated Medicare and Medic-
aid reimbursements for fiscal years 1980
through   1984 will provide an    additional
$97,724,000 to be utilized by the Indian
Health Service and tribal entities which op-
erate tribally-owned health facilities in cor-
recting deficiencies in health facilities and
services to bring such health facilities up to
standard. Other health resources from fed-
eral, state, and local sources will be utilized
by tribes and urban Indian organizations to
supplement the resources provided under the
authority of S. 2728 in order to meet the
total unmet health needs of the Indian pop-
ulation.
Mr. President, the Select Committee
on Indian Affairs believes that S. 2728,
an original bill drafted by the commit-
tee, will go far in bringing the health
status of the Indian population up to the
level of that of the general American
population. I urge the support of my col-
leagues in the Senate for passage of this
most important measure.*
