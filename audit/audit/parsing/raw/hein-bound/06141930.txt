It has been charged tine and again that a tariff bill with
rates so high that they really give protection tends to destroy
our foreign snarket. That charge is disproven by figures com-
piled by the Department of Commerce, and I herewith insert
it compilation of imports and exports by the Department of
Commerce during the time that the Fordney-McCumber tariff
law was in effect from 1922 to 1,929:

From the foregoing it will be seen that both inports and ex-
ports showed a corresponding increase from year to year. In
1927 it is estimated that our total production in this country
was $80,000,000,000, of which $62,718,000,000 was in the form of
manufactured goods, while the gross value of our agricultural
products was $17,153,000,000. It will thus be seen tlt our ex-
ports represent a small percentage of the total value of our
production and that the home market consumes by far the great-
est part of that which we produce. It therefore becomes in-
creasingly evident that it is necessary for us to protect the
Anserican market that it may be preserved to American pro-
ducers. So long as colmpeting countries maintain low wage
scales, long hours of toil, and poor living conditions, it will be
necessary for the Ans.crican people to laintain the protective-
tariff system. We must bear in mid that we are living under
the best conditions of any people in the world and our civiliza-
tion is the highest. Until other countries have reached our
level it will be necessary for us to maintain the protective-tariff
system, or, abandoning that, we must reconcile ourselves to
descending to the levels that are to be found in foreign and
competing hnds.
Mr. HARDY. Mr. Speaker, I want to add to the volumes
that have been spoken and written about the new tariff act of
1930 just as few words and some convincing figures.
In comparison to the great quantity of stuff that has been
spoken and written about this tariff act I think that probably
fewer actual facts have lodged in the minds of hearers and
readers than in connection with any other incident il history.
I am going to cut out the oratory and argument and try to get
down to a few brief facts and discuss this tariff act chiefly as
to its benefit to the State of Colorado.
To begin with it should be emphasized that two-thirds of the
imports into the United States are on the free list. So the
tariff applies only to about one-third of the imports that come
into this country.
Of approxinlately 3,300 items in the tariff list, only about 890
receive an increased rate, 235 are decreased, and 2,175 items
remain the same as they were.
Of the total value of all imports into the United States, the
increases iu the tariff act will apply to only 221/2 per cent. So
that 77/2 per cent of the total values of imports remain the
same or are reduced.
Collections for customs under the 1922 tariff act for 1928
was $522,649,383. If the rates in this new act had been ap-
plied on same imports, the collections would have been
$630,456,280.
The increases in the new act are divided 68 per cent o agri-
cultural products and 32 per cent Ol industrial items. So in
money value of duties collected on 1928 imports the increase
would have been $72,181,314 on agricultural products and
$36,402,057 ols industrial items.
Clearly agriculture has the best of it -under this tariff act.
No tariff ever written has treated the products of the farm, the
stock range, and the dairy so favorably.
COLORADO AN AGRICULTURAL STAT
Colorado is chiefly an agricultural State. Many people do not
know tiat. Our own people are just beginning to realize and
appreciate this fact.
Agricultural production for Colorado for 1928, from  her
farms, gardens, and stock ranges, including sugar, amounted to
about $180,000,000.
Mineral production, including gold, coal, and oil, was about
$58,855,000.
Many, perhaps most, of the items of agriculture In that
$180,000,000 yearly production will receive an increased benefit
by this tariff act of 1930.
Look over this table furnished me by the Tariff Commission
which wilt show you what the tariff on many products of
Colorado farms was under the Democratic tariff act of 1913,
was under the 1922 tariff act, is now under the tariff act of
1930, and the increases made by tills new law.

The average i.nrregs of import duties in the 1930 act as compared with the 1922
act on the above-named farm products is 97 per cent.
Under the flexible provisions of the 1922 act, President Coolidge, by proclamation,
increased the duty on wheat from 30 to 42 cents per bushel; butter and butter sub-
stitutes from 8 to 12 cents per'pound; cream from 20 to 30 cents per gallon. Flax
was increased from 40 to 56 cents per bushel by President Hoover in May, 1929.
LIVESTOCK
One of the most important industries in Colorado is livestock.
The value of our dairy cattle is estimated at $18,788,000, and
of beef cattle $54,014,000.
The total United States imports of cattle during a recent year
amounted to $20,000,000 in value. These cattle come chiefly
from Canada. The duty on cattle in this new law carries an
increase of about 60 per cent over the rates in effect at present
under the 1922 act. Lightweight cattle come in at a lower rale
tihan heavier cattle. This new law reduces the upper limit of
the lightweight cattle group from 1,050 pounds to 700 pounds,
thus, under the new     law, making all cattle weighing from        700
pounds to 1,050 pounds dutiable at a higher rate. Therefore,
in effect, the new law virtually doubles the duty on cattle.
The rates on cattle have been raised as follows: Cattle weigh-
ing less than 700 pounds, from 1  cents up to 2%         cents. Cattle
weighing 700 pounds and more, from 2 cents per pound up to 3
cents per pound.
The tariff on beef and veal, however, is more important and
that rate has been raised from 3 cents to 6 cents per pound-a
100 per cent increase.
And hides have been given a protection for the first time since
1909-the rate being 10.per cent of their value.
S 1EEP
Sheep raising is an important enterprise in a number of
counties in Colorado--especially in the San Luis Valley and in
the lower Arkansas Valley.         Many snug little fortunes have
been  made by sheepinen.        And nobody anywhere appreciates
the value of a tariff more than does an owner of a sheep ranch,
for on no thing is the tariff so definitely and quickly reflected

as is a tariff on sheep and wool. Really, the tariff on sheep is
not so very important as we import only a few, but the tariff
on wool and mutton does have a quick and beneficial effect on
the price of a sheep. It is estimated that we have in Colorado
about 2,780,000 sheep and lambs valued at $29,615,000. The
tariff on sheep has been raised from $2 per head to $3 per head,
and the tariff on mutton has been raised from 21/2 cents to 5
cents per pound.
WOOL
It is estimated that we produce in Colorado about $3,009.U00
worth of wool in a year.
In wool, however, we find large imports, amounting to
$42,000,000 in 1929. The new law carries a rate of duty of 34
cents per pound on clean wool, which represents an increase of
3 cents per pound over the present rate. In wool we find the
present duty practically fully effective in that the United States
price of wool is higher than the London price for the same grade
of wool by the amount of duty.
This tariff on sheep, niulton, and wool Is certainly worth
millions of dollars to the growers of Colorado. I recall travel-
ing through the San Luis Valley about 1920, when there was
no tariff on wool and mutton. Growers could not sell their
wool for 12 cents a pound, and many ewes sold at $3 or less
per head. The sheepmen were all broke. But with the passage
of the 1922 tariff the industry became prosperous. I know on
account of general conditions it is none too good just now;
but picture if you can what it would be now if all the enormous
crop of wool grown in New Zealand and Australia could come
in free of duty. And even now, try to buy a bunch of. ewes
at $3 per head, if you can.
DAIRY PRODUCTS
The dairy industry is growing to be one of our most in-
portant. The annual stock show in Deimver brings out some
of the finest dairy stock in the country. Dairy cattle in the
State in 1929 were estimated to have I value of $18.788,000.
Milk and milk products from our Colorado farms and dairies
in 1928 had a value of $21,470,000.
We import a great deal more milk and cheese than we ex-
port. So that a tariff on these items is directly beneficial to
our farmers. On dairy products the new tariff act has been
very liberal.
Tariff on milk has been raised from 2  cents per gallon
under the act of 1.922 to 31 cents per gallon by President's
proclamation, and now to 61/ cents per gallon in this new.law.
Tariff on cheese was 5 cents under the old law, has been raised
to 7 cents per pound, but not less than 40 per cent of its value.
Butter was 8 cents per pound, then raised by presidential order
to 12 cents, and now under this act it goes up to 14 cents per
pound.
SUoAR
Colorado produces more beet sugar than any other State in
the Union. The value of the sugar beets raised by the farmer
is about $16,758,000. This crop simply could not be raised
without a tariff on sugar. The tariff has been 1.76 cents per
pound on Cuban raw sugar and this act boosts the rate to 2
cents per pound on Cuban sugar.
This increase is the equivalent of 70 cents on the average
refined sugar content realized from a ton of beets. The average
price of sugar is relatively low at this time under the present
tariff. With the increase provided the price to the consumer
would not be relatively higher, and the increase in the tariff
will stabilize the sugar production in this country and also
avoid the necessity of depending upon the foreign producer for
our supply, which we would have to do if the sugar industry in
our country is not amply protected.
]M iANS AND pEAS
Beans and peas are becoming one of our big crops: many
are raised on dry lands. You might be surprised to know that
one Of the largest shippers of beans and peas in the United
States is located at the city of Trinidad, Colo., which city Is
chiefly noted for its coal-mining operations.
Colorado produced last year 803,000 bushels of field peas.
valued at $1,518,000, and 1,390,000 bushels of dried beans valued
it $4,726,000.
The new tariff act raises the duty on dried peas from 1 cent
per pound to 13/1 Cents per pound. And on dried beans the rate
is raised from 1% cents to 3 cents per pound. This little item
will certainly help a lot of people, many of whom are in dry-
farming sections.
The lroduction of onions oil a large scale is rather a new
thing in Colorado, but some sections have been going ahead
rapidly. Otero County probably produces more than any other
county in the State, and when the price is good it Is a profitable

RECORD-IIOUSE                                JUNE 14
crop. The production of onidns for Colorado for 192S is given
at 1,147,000 bushels, valued at $1,629,000.
The trouble with the onion market has been heavy imports
from  foreign lands. InI 1928 the imports were valued at
$2,660,875.
The tariff on onions was 1 cent per pound under the 1922 act.
By presidential proclamation it was raised to 1/2 cents in Janu-
ary, 1929, and this new act brings the duty up to 21/2 cents per
pound. If our American growers do not overdo a good thing,
they should get a better price in the future.
pOTATOES
Colorado's potato crop is quoted at about 13,420,000 bushels,
valued at about $6,039,000.
Much of this crop Is raised in the San Luis Valley. The
value, of course, depends upon the current price, and that varies
greatly with the question of. under or over production in this
country. Our imports and exports of potatoes run about equal
in value, a little in excess of $3,000,000 annually. The tariff
on this item is not always fully, effective, especially when we
produce much more than we can consume. The rate under the
1922 act was 50 cents iper, 100 pounds. It has been raised under
the new act to 75 cents per hundred pounds, which is a 50 per
cent increase. It will help stabilize the price and discourage
imports from Canada.
BROOMCORN
This is a little-heard-of crop in any country, but is becoming
important in some sections of Colorado. 'robably more is
raised in Baca County, Colo., than in any other county in the
West. It is a profitable crop and an excellent quality is pro-
duced in some western dry-farming sections without irrigation.
In 1929 Colorado produced 9,100 tons, estimated value, $1,019,-
000. The production in 1930 will probably be greater and it will
be greatly increased in future years. I think there has never
been a tariff on broomeorn-certainly not in the acts of 1913 and
1922-but this new act now gives a. duty of $20 per ton. This
item will he a great encouragement to the growers of Baca
County and eastern Colorado.
POULTY
Poultry is a big product on most farms and many aI house-
wife gets her spending money by raising chickens, turkeys, and
eggs for the market. In addition to that source, many are
going into the poultry business on a bigger scale and are making
it pay. Colorado is especially well adapted for poultry raising.
The tariff has a decided effect upon the price of poultry and
eggs, and, strange to say, our heavy imports come from China.
In 1928 the income in Colorado for poultry (chickens) was
estimated at $4,253,000; for eggs, $6,952,000. Turkeys large-
but not given.
This new tariff act has treated those who sell poultry, eggs,
and so forth, very well Indeed. Duty on poultry alive has been
raised from 3 cents per pound to 8 cents per pound; dressed,
from 6 cents to 10 cents per pound. Turkeys, from 6 cents to
10 cents per pound. Eggs, fresh, have been raised from 8 cents
to 11 cents per dozen.
IN CONCLUSION
Much buncombe lhis been and will be spoken and written about
the tariff. Nothing new will probably be said about this act
that was not said about the act of 1922 and previous tariff laws.
Millions of dollars have been spent by interested parties in
spreading publicity and propaganda to discourage the passage
of this bill and to make it unpopular in the country. Chief
among these is the minority party which would profit by mak-
ing any legislation passed by this Congress unpopular in the
country at and near election time.
The Cuban sugar interests lave spent hundreds of thousands
of dollars for propaganda to make a higher tariff on sugar un-
popular. Big business men in the automobile and other lines
who are establishing factories in foreign lands to profit by low
wages and escape taxation do not want a tariff on their im-
ports.
Big merchants and importers who like to buy low in foreign
lands of cheap wages and sell high to the American trade have
contributed to the propaganda. International bankers who
know no country and have their investments spread out over
the world oppose the theory of protection.
The opposition to the tariff has been systemitized, highly
financed, and efficiently managed by high-powered executives,
clever publicity men, and scheming politicians.
In the big cities the agricultural rates are attacked. People
are told that the raise hi tariff on sugar will limit the working-
man to fewer spoonfuls for his coffee and rob the children of
their stick candy; that the tariff on cream, butter, cheese,
mutton, beef, and a dozen other products of the farm will
nake living inordinately high for the workingmen in factory

towns. In these sections the propagandists complain that the
nlew tariff is not high enough on the things they make but too
high on the things we grow in the West.
In the agricultural sections of the country this well-planned
propaganda takes the form of attacks on the industrial rates.
Efforts have been and will be made to show the farmer that
the things he buys will cost more; that the price on harness
and shoes, neckties and furniture, shaving mugs and wrist
watches will go up. Most of the stuff you hear about increased
cost of living under a new tariff measure is largely exagger-
ated, and many complaints will be heard about the price of
things which are o1 the free list and osl which no duty is paid.
However, the object of a protective tariff is to preserve the
American market for the American producer. If the fac-
tories of the great industrial centers can be kept open and
call afford to pay living wages of American standards to their
employees who consume largely the products of the farm, I
presume we of the agricultural producing sections can afford,
if necessary, to pay a little more for a little of the stuff we
wear or use.
It is interesting to note that a great many items which the
farmer is interested in are on the free list entirely unaffected
by the tariff.
This free list Includes all agricultural implements aldi ma-
ehinery, including cream separators up to a certain value, trac-
tors, milk cans, all naterials used chiefly for fertilizer, fuel
oil and gasoline, harness and saddlery up to a certain value,
binding twine, and numerous other items.
And finally the flexible provision of the act of 1922 is retained
and improved so that the President on recommendation of the
Tariff Commission can raise or lower the duty on any item 50 per
cent at any time. This is a safeguard and offers opportunity for
correcting any inequality or meeting any emergency that may
arise. Under this same provision agriculture has benefited some-
times in the past-notably when the duties were raised by
presidential proclamation on wheat, onions, milk, cheese, butter,
frozen eggs, and so forth.
DETAILED INFORMATION ABOUT COLORADO AGRICULTURAL CROPS
As a matter of information some may like to know more
about what Colorado produces in various agricultural lines. So
I am inserting here three interesting tables:
Table 1 shows the acreage production and value in 1928 of
Colorado farm crops. It will be noted from this table tllat in
addition to the expected production of staple grains, such as
wheat, corn, barley, rye, and oats, there is a production of
specialty crops. The reason for this is that there has been
developed in Colorado the practice of growing more and 1more
of its farm crops under irrigation.
I have already pointed out that Colorado is the leading State
in the production of beet sugar, the value of the annual produc-
tion of sugar being about $41,000,000.

I This item Includes the entire acreage of corn, whether harvested for mature corn,
cut for silage or dry forage, or hogged off.
I in addition to the acreage harvested for grain, it is estimated that approximately
92 000 acres of oats was cut green for hay, this additional acreage appearing in the hay
table.
8 In addition to the rye and barley acreage harvested for grain, there is some acreage
of barley and about 33,000 acres of rye cut green for hay or used for pasturage.
4 Acreages of grain sorghums and field peas include the crop actually saved for grain
and such acreage as is cut green and fed as forage, the grain value being about the same
in either ease.
6 This acreage of millet saved for seed is in addition to the area harvested for bay
as shown in the hay table.

Colorado, because of its extensive grazing lauds, early devel-
oped to an important cattle and sheep country. In addition,
there las been established an important dairy enterprise. Table
2 shows the estimated number and value of livestock in the
State of Colorado as of January 1, 1929:

The preceding tables show the value of the farm production
of crops and livestock in Colorado. Table 3, which follows, is
ai estimate of the gross income received from farm production
in 1928. This estimate is taken from the official figures of the
United States Department of Agriculture and should be studied
with the knowledge that certain crops, such as corn, which
have a large farm value yield relatively a small income to
the farmer from sale as corn. Tile main part of the incosne,
however, is derived from the sale of livestock to which the corn
has beeti fed. Thus in the table following, which gives the
gross income, the income derived from corn applies to corn
sold as such. The remainder of the corn produced by the farmer
has been included in the various livestock and livestock proilucts
listed.

Mr. REID of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, the American watch
manufacturer was seriously handicapped because of the in-
adequacy of the tariff act of 1922, and the unfair and isn-
ethical practices of unscrupulous importers.
For anyone to realize what the American manufacturer of
watches has been confronted with during the past few years,
lIe must know the story of the nefarious methods and practices
of the ring of those unscrupulous importers, who have stooped
to the lowest and meanest of crimes in order to line their
l)ockets with gold.
