privatization contract. It has been trans-
ferred to the Defense Environmental Res-
toration and Waste Management appropria-
tion account and will be funded there in fu-
ture appropriation acts.
GENERAL PROVISIONS
DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY
Sec. 301. The conference agreement in-
cludes a provision proposed by the House
that none of the funds may be used to award
a management and operating contract unless
such contract is awarded using competitive
procedures, or the Secretary of Energy
grants a waiver to allow for such a deviation.
Section 301 does not preclude extension of a
contract awarded using competitive proce-
dures.
Sec. 302. The conference agreement in-
cludes a provision proposed by the House and
Senate that none of the funds may be used to
prepare or implement workforce restruc-
turing plans or provide enhanced severance
payments and other benefits and community
assistance grants for Federal employees of
the Department of Energy under section 3161
of the National Defense Authorization Act of
Fiscal Year 1993, Public Law 102-484.
Sec. 303. The conference agreement modi-
fies a provision proposed by the House that
none of the funds may be used to augment
the $24,500,000 made available for obligation

for severance payments and other benefits
and community assistance grants unless the
Department of Energy submits a reprogram-
ming request subject to approval by the ap-
propriate Congressional committees.
Sec. 304. The conference agreement in-
cludes a provision proposed by the House and
Senate that none of the funds may be used to
prepare or initiate Requests for Proposals for
a program if the program has not been fund-
ed by Congress in the current fiscal year.
This provision precludes the Department
from initiating activities for new programs
which have been proposed in the budget re-
quest, but which have not yet been funded by
Congress.
Sec. 305. The conference agreement in-
cludes a provision proposed by the House and
Senate that permits the transfer and merger
of unexpended balances of prior appropria-
tions with appropriation accounts estab-
lished in this bill.
Sec. 306. The conference agreement in-
cludes language providing that not to exceed
6 percent of funds shall be available for Lab-
oratory Directed Research and Development.
Sec. 307. The conference agreement in-
cludes language limiting to $185,000,000 the
funds available for reimbursement of man-
agement and operating contractor travel ex-
penses. Of the $185,000,000, $175,000,000 is
available for contractor travel and $10,000,000
is to be held in reserve by the Department's
Chief Financial Officer for emergency travel
requirements. The language also requires the
Department of Energy to reimburse contrac-
tors for travel consistent with regulations
applicable to Federal employees and speci-
fies that the travel ceiling does not apply to
travel funded from Laboratory Directed Re-
search and Development funds.
Sec. 308. The conference agreement in-
cludes language prohibiting the Bonneville
Power Administration from performing en-
ergy efficiency services outside the legally
defined Bonneville service territory.
Sec. 309. The conference agreement in-
cludes language limiting the types of waste
that can be disposed of in the Waste Isola-
tion Pilot Plant in New Mexico. None of the
funds may be used to dispose of transuranic
waste in excess of 20 percent plutonium by
weight for the aggregate of any material cat-
egory. At the Rocky Flats site, this provi-
sion includes ash residues; salt residues; wet
residues; direct repackage residues; and
scrub alloy as referenced in the "Final Envi-
ronmental Impact Statement on Manage-
ment of Certain Plutonium Residues and
Scrub Alloy Stored at the Rocky Flats Envi-
ronmental Technology Site".
Sec. 310. The conference agreement in-
cludes language allowing the Administrator
of the National Nuclear Security Adminis-
tration to authorize certain nuclear weapons
production plants to use not more than 2 per-
cent of available funds for research, develop-
ment and demonstration activities.

tivities relating to the formation and oper-
ation of a regional transmission organiza-
tion.
Sec. 312. The conference agreement in-

tional funding.

cludes language proposed by the Senate that

would provide a three year term of office for
the first person appointed to the position of
the Under Secretary of Nuclear Security of
the Department of Energy.
Sec. 314. The conference agreement in-
cludes language proposed by the Senate lim-
iting the authority of the Secretary of En-
ergy to modify the organization of the Na-
tional Nuclear Security Administration.
Sec. 315. The conference agreement in-
cludes language proposed by the Senate pro-
hibiting the pay of personnel engaged in con-
current service or duties inside and outside
the National Nuclear Security Administra-
tion.
Report on impacts of lunits on on-site stor-
age.-The conference agreement does not in-
clude statutory language proposed by the
Senate, but the conferees direct that not
later than 90 days after enactment of the fis-
cal year 2001 Energy and Water Development
Appropriations Act, the Secretary of Energy
shall submit to Congress a report containing
a description of all alternatives that are
available to the Northern States Power Com-
pany and the Federal government to allow
the company to continue to operate the
Prairie Island nuclear generating plant until
the end of the term of the license issued to
the company by the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission, in view of a law of the State of
Minnesota that limits the quantity of spent
nuclear fuel that may be stored at the plant,
assuming that the existing Federal and
State laws remain unchanged.
Report on electricity prices.-The conferees
note that California is currently experi-
encing an energy crisis. Wholesale elec-
tricity prices have soared, resulting in elec-
trical bills that have increased by as much
as 300 percent in the San Diego area. Con-
ferees understand that the staff of the Fed-
eral Energy Regulatory Commission is cur-
rently investigating the crisis. The Commis-
sion is directed to submit to Congress a re-
port on the results of the investigation no
later than December 1, 2000. The report shall
include identification of the causes of the
San Diego price increases, a determination
whether California  wholesale electricity
markets are competitive, a recommendation
whether a regional price cap should be set in
the Western States, a determination whether
manipulation of prices has occurred at the
wholesale level, and a determination of rem-
edies, including legislation or regulations,
that are necessary to correct the problem
and prevent similar incidents in California
and elsewhere in the United States.
Provisions not adopted by the conferees.-The
conference agreement deletes language pro-
posed by the House and Senate prohibiting
the use of funds for contracts modified in a
manner that deviates from the Federal Ac-
quisition Regulation.
