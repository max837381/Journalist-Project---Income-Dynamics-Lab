ONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE

S. 710, the Vicksburg Campaign Trail
Battlefields Preservation Act of 1999, is
a bipartisan measure that authorizes a
feasibility study on the preservation of
Civil War battlefields and related sites
in the four states along the Vicksburg
Campaign Trail.
As my colleagues know, Vicksburg
served as a gateway to the Mississippi
River during the Civil War. The eight-
een month campaign for the "Gibraltar
of the Confederacy" included over
100,000 soldiers and involved a number
of skirmishes and major battles in Mis-
sissippi, Arkansas, Louisiana, and Ten-
nessee.
The Mississippi Heritage Trust and
the National Trust for Historic Preser-
vation named the Vicksburg Campaign
Trail as being among the most threat-
ened sites in the state and the nation.
S. 710 would begin the process of pre-
serving the important landmarks in
the four state region that warrant fur-
ther protection. I appreciate the co-
sponsorship of Chairman MURKOWSKI,
Chairman   THOMAS,    and   Senators
LANDRIEU, BREAUX, COCHRAN. HUTCH-
INSON. and CRAIG on this measure.
Mr. President, the Senate also ap-
proved S. 1117. the Corinth Battlefield
Preservation Act of 1999, a measure
that establishes the Corinth Unit of
the Shiloh National Military Park.
The battle of Shiloh was actually
part of the Union Army's overall effort
to seize Corinth. This small town was
important to both the Confederacy and
the Union. Corinth's railway was vi-
tally important to both sides as it
served as a gateway for moving troops
and supplies north and south, east and
west. The overall campaign led to some
of the bloodiest battles in the Western
Theater. In an effort to protect the
city, Southern forces built a series of
earthworks and fortifications, many of
which remain, at least for now, in pris-
tine condition. Unfortunately, the Na-
tional Park Service in its Profiles of
America's Most Threatened Civil War
Battlefields, concluded that many of
the sites associated with the siege of
Corinth are threatened.
S. 1117 would give Corinth its proper
place in American history by formally
linking the city's battlefield sites with
the Shiloh National Military Park.
Mr. President, I want to thank Sen-
ators ROBB, COCHRAN, and JEFFORDS for
cosponsoring this measure.
I would also like to express my ap-
preciation to Chairman THOMAS for his
ever vigilant efforts on parks legisla-
tion, and in particular, for moving both
the Vicksburg Campaign Trail and Cor-
inth battlefield bills forward.
I would also like to take this oppor-
tunity to recognize Chairman MUR-
KOWSKI for his continued stewardship
over the Senate Energy and Natural
Resources Committee.
Mr. President, I also want to recog-
nize Ken P'Pool, Deputy State Historic
Preservation Officer for Mississippi;

557

Rosemary Williams, Chairman of the
Siege and Battle of Corinth Commis-
sion: John Sullivan, President of the
Friends of the Vicksburg Campaign and
Historic Trail; and Terry Winschel and
Woody Harrell of the United States
Park Service for their support and
guidance on these important preserva-
tion measures.
Lastly, I would like to recognize sev-
eral staff members including Randy
Turner, Jim   O'Toole, and   Andrew
Lundquist from   the Senate Energy
Committee, Darcie Tomasallo from
Senate Legislative Counsel, and Stan
Harris, Angel Campbell, Steven Wall.
Jim  Sartucci, and Steven Apicella
from my office, for their efforts to pre-
serve Mississippi's and America's his-
toric resources.
Mr. President, as a result of the Sen-
ate's action today, our children will be
better able to understand and appre-
ciate the full historic, social, cultural.
and economic impact of the Vicksburg
Campaign Trail and the Siege and Bat-
tle of Corinth.
GREENSPAN CONFIRMATION VOTE
Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I was in-
formed that the vote on the Greenspan
nomination would be at 6 p.m. on
Wednesday. so I had rearranged my
schedule to return to my State. As I
am unable to be present for the 10:30
a.m. Thursday vote, I ask that the
RECORD show that if I were present to
vote, I would vote in favor of con-
firming Alan Greenspan for another
term as Chairman of the Federal Re-
serve Board of Governors.
ANNOUNCEMENT OF ABSENCE
Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I want
the RECORD to show that I ask unani-
mous consent to be excused from vot-
ing on Thursday and Friday of this
week. I am leaving for the West Coast
for a matter of urgent personal concern
in connection with the airline crash,
and I will not be here to vote. I want
the RECORD to show why I am not here.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, the RECORD will so reflect.
PEACEKEEPING THE DEMOCRATIC
REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO
Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise
to speak about the crisis in the Demo-
cratic Republic of the Congo. In that
devastated country, we see one of the
worst international crises of the last
decade. It is a bloody and brutal con-
flict, one that has drawn country after
country into an un-winnable struggle,
one that has cost the lives of thousands
of civilians and has displaced hundreds
of thousands more, and one about
which this body has been strangely
quiet.
Congo's conflict is as complex as it is
destructive. It is born of the long ab-
sence of any semblance of political le-
gitimacy in the government of that

battered state, it is fed by the horri-
fying legacy of the Rwandan genocide,
and it is intensified by the constant
struggle for resources and wealth in
the region. The litany of the causes of
the war in Congo is a catalogue of the
problems that plague the heart of Afri-
ca. Its outcome will likely determine
the course of the region's future.
Mr. President, we need to wake up
and realize that the U.S. has a stake in
that future. Our interests in global
peace and stability, the rule of law, and
respect for basic human rights are
bound up in Congo's future. Africans
and their potential American trading
partners can have no hope of realizing
Africa's vast economic potential until
the region's cycles of violence come to
an end. And America urgently needs to
stop the spread of infectious disease, to
address  environmental degradation,
and to build a global coalition to fight
international crime-but these needs
cannot be met without stability in cen-
tral Africa.
And Mr. President, global forces of
instability will thrive, and their insid-
ious influence will grow, when parties
to the conflict in Congo turn to them,
in desperation, for support.
Mr. President, central Africa's lead-
ers know that the region cannot pros-
per while the war in the D.R.C. con-
tinues. For that reason, last summer
the parties to the conflict signed a
blueprint for ending the conflict-the
Lusaka Agreement. That Agreement
calls for an end to the fighting, for a
free political dialogue within Congo,
and lays out the path to the with-
drawal of foreign forces.
Mr. President, I traveled to many of
the countries involved in the crisis at
the end of last year. In Angola,
Zimbabwe, and Namibia, in Uganda and
Rwanda, and in the D.R.C. itself, I per-
sonally heard heads of state acknowl-
edge the importance of making the
Lusaka Agreement work. They under-
stand the challenge before them, the
precious  opportunity  embodied   by
Lusaka.
Last week the parties to the Congo
conflict renewed their commitment to
the Lusaka Agreement in a series of
extraordinary meetings at the United
Nations in New York. They have all
agreed to a facilitator, former Presi-
dent Masire of Botswana, to move the
inter-Congolese dialogue forward. And
all parties have called for a strength-
ening of the Joint Military Commis-
sion that is at the heart of the frame-
work for peace.
Mr. President, just as the U.S. has a
stake in the outcome, the United
States also has a role to play in sup-
porting these efforts. The U.N. has al-
ready deployed a small team of liaison
officers to the scene. Now, the United
Nations Secretary General has issued a
report laying out the next phase of
U.N. involvement. It calls for the de-
ployment of 500 monitors, with a 5,000-

strong force providing security and
logistical support to their mission.
They will have a robust mandate that
ensures their ability to protect them-
selves.
Mr. President, none of the troops
would be American, and that is as it
should be. In fact, in my meetings with
heads of state in the region, I explicitly
asked about their expectations with re-
gard to American troops, and I can re-
port that no one has visions of a large
American presence on the ground in
Congo. But by creating the breathing
room necessary to allow the belliger-
ents to move toward peace, these
troops will serve American interests.
The U.N. Secretary-General has en-
dorsed a good plan. Its value comes, in
part, from what it does not do. The
U.N. does not plan to send tens of thou-
sands of troops into Congo to impose
peace on hostile parties. Nor does the
U.N. intend to stand by while the most
brutal elements in Congo seize power
through violence and impose their will
on civilians.
Instead, the plan that has emerged in
New York harnesses international sup-
port to the commitment of the parties
to the conflict. It recognizes that the
only viable peace to be found in Congo
is a peace created by the belligerent
parties themselves. It acknowledges
African responsibility for this African
war, and strengthens the Joint Mili-
tary Commission created by combat-
ants when they signed the Lusaka ac-
cords. At the same time, this plan en-
sures that the international commu-
nity does not turn its back on Africa.
There can be no double-standard,
whereby African conflicts are meas-
ured by a different scale than that used
for conflicts in Europe or Asia. The
plan for the deployment of the mon-
itors and their supporting team has
been vetted as thoroughly as any U.N.
project. The stakes-in terms of human
life and regional stability-are unques-
tionably high enough to meet the
threshold for international action.
Now, the U.N. has an opportunity to
get it right in Congo.
Supporting this U.N. mission is the
least we should do to secure our inter-
ests and fulfill our responsibilities as
responsible members of the inter-
national community. Should we fail to
support it, should we ignore this ter-
rible conflict any longer, we will weak-
en  the  international community's
mechanisms for burden-sharing at the
dawn of this new century. And we will
lose an opportunity to reinforce a
model for ending conflict and embrac-
ing a better future.
I want to say, because obviously this
has to be true and I am concerned
about it, that the plan is not guaran-
teed to succeed.
Little worth attempting ever is.
Zambian President Frederick Chiluba
was right when he said, last week, that
no peacekeeping operation anywhere in

the world is risk-free. But Mr. Presi-
dent, this is the best chance for shoring
up the Lusaka Agreement and helping
African states to end the conflict that
we are likely to see.
I strongly urge my colleagues to look
at this program that is being suggested
and to give it their support.
