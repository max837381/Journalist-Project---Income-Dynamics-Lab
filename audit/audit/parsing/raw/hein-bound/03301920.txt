"values " and insert in lieu thereof the word "valued."
The CHAIR.MAN. The question is on agreeing to the amend-
ment.
The question was taken, and the amendment was. agreed to.
Mr. GREEN of Iowa. Mr. Chairman, I offer another amend-

ing" insert the figures "567."
The CHAIR.MAN. The gentleman. from Iowa offers an amend-
ment, which the Clerk will report.
The Clerk read as follows:
Page 2, line 18. before the word " Printing," insert the figures " 567,'
and strike out the quotation marks before the word " Printing."
The CHAIRMAN. The question is on agreeing to the amend-
ment.
The question was taken, and the amendment was agreed to.
* The Clerk read as follows:
Szc. 2. That this act shall expire by limitation: at the' end of two
years from the date of its passage, and section 600 of the act approved
September 8, 1916, entitled "An act to increase the revenue, and for
other purposes," shall agaili become operative in Its steadi
Also the following committee amendment was-read:
Committee amendment: Line 2, page 3, strike out the words " two
years " and insert in lieu thereof the words " one year:"
The CHAIRMAN. Tlie' question is on agreeing to the com-
mittee amendment.
Mr. WALSH. I would like to ask the gentleman having this
measure in charge the reason which prompted the committee to
ieduce this term? Does he think that any benefit will be derived
during this short time of one year?
Mr. GREEN of Iowa. I will say to the gentleman that it was
upon my motion this time was reduced- The reason I had for
offering this amendment was that I did npt want to do anything
in any way which would tend to discourage the creation of new
mills, which I believe to be the only way in which paper prices
will ever be reduced. I think this country, at least in Alaska and
in certain parts of Washington, is admirably adapted for the
production of paper pulp and paper. itself,. and it is my great
desire that some new mills be erected. I believe if this period
was made two years it might, perhaps, have some tendency to
develop the establishment of new mills, whereas if it was fixed
at one year, and at the end' of the year it was necessary to con-
tinue it, it would be necessary to continue it for another year
or two years, as the case might be.
Mr. WALSH. If the gentleman will permit, it takes three
years to establish a mill. Now, the time having been' reduced, to
one year; with the gentleman's statement that it would be easy
to extend it another year or another two years, might not that
very possibility, that the term is now made. so short that it
will probably have to be extended, also result in deterring
interests from entering upon the construction of mills?'
Mr. GREEN of Iowa. I hardly think so. And my friend from
Oregon [Mr. HAWLEY], at my right, suggests also another mat-

ter .fthat was' taken into consideration by' the committee, that
it was possible in some instancos to somewhat extend the ca-
pacity of the mills, not withh', a very brief time, but possibly
within d year and a half or so, and if possible w' wanted to
encourage such extension of the mills. At this particular time
there is a large mill under construction, I understand, in the
State of Washington. Just how near it is to completion I can
not say, but my recollection is that the gentleman from Wash-
ington [Mr. HA.DLEY] said it would be completed in about a
year.
Mr. HADLEY. I understaid' ie is substantially completed
now and will be ready for operation in the near future. I have'
not seen the mill for a good while. But that is the first unit, and
other units are in contemplation.
Mr. WALSH. Do I understand that unless these mills are
permitted to get the exorbitant pices for print paper they are
not going to-start in constructing them in the future?
Mr.;GREEN of Iowa. No; but this raises the limitation so
that the tariff would not apply except in case there was an ex-
orbitant price. For that reason I thought it was Well.to"limit
the time.
Mr. MANN of Illinois. Mr. Chairman, I do not feel at all
confident that this bill will have any practical. effect upon the
newspaper situation. Paper coming from Canada is now
absorbed, all that the Canadian Government will permit to be
exported, and I think there is ho paper coming in that costs now
so much as 5 cents a pound. It may have a tendency to keep
the' price down in future contracts; There has been' some hope
that with the high prices of paper in this country there might
come a considerable trade with Scandinavian countries, where
they have a cheap process of manufacturing paper, with the
wood at hand and the water power at hand. I doubt very much
whether you will be able to build up much of a trade in paper
with the Scandinavian countries with the provision that youi 'nly
invite such trade for one year. While paper is not a commodity
that is accumulated-it is used from day to day, and newspapers
live from hand to mouth so far as paper is concerned, because
-it takes up so much rooi for storage that it can not afford usu-
ally to store' it-still the paper is usually disposed of in advance:
'Because of its bulky nature print-paper manufacturers never
manufacture supplies largely in advance They may. have a'
considerable supply, but the storage of paper amounts to so
much that as a rule it is not made in large quantities unless
they know where they are going to sell it.
We are inviting Scandinavian paper mills to send us paper
'because we have- a large shortage just now, but we hid only' ex-
tending this' invitation so far as this bill is concerned for one
year, and I do not think that the invitation wil. be very gener
ally accepted. People do not start out with new lines of trade on
the- assumption that if they build up trade it is going to be cut
off at the end of a: year. It will not be done by the Scandinavian
mfianufacturers; it would not be done by' American manufac-
turers; it would not be done by anybody who had common sense,
aid common sense rules to a large extent the tfade of the *oild.
While It looks well and sounds fine, it diccomplishds nothing.'
The CHAIRMAN. The question is on agreeing to the com'
mittee amendment.
The question was. taken, and the Chair announced that the
noes seeiied to have It.
Mr. GREEN of Iowa. Division, Mr. Chalrmai.
The committee divided; and there'were-a-yes. 44, noes 27. •
So the amendment was agreed to.
Mr. WALSH. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike out the last
word, for the purpose of'askfng the 'gentleman from Iowa a,
question.
The CHAIRMAN. The gentleman from Massachusetts moves
to strike out the last word.
Mr: WALSH. Wliat is, going to. be the effect of this legisla-
tion at the end of one year? Section 2 says that "this it
shall expire by limitation nat the end' of one'year from the
date of its passdge" and section 600 shall become oporative in.

Now, section 600 is still operative. This act will continue, It
In operation, and its operation has' not been suspended. Sec-
tion 600 is amended by this act, but its operation is t6 cohtinue6
in effect, aid section 2 of this bill says that it shall 'hgaih be'
come operative. I wanted to get the gentlem'an's idea of What
the effect Would be at the end of the one-year period.
Mr. GREEN of Iowa. The gentleman suggests a matter that
I think might, perhaps, be mended by a further amendmont. It
Was not expected, I will say, that this bill should come up to-
day at all. I did not draw the bill in the first instance and did
not report the bill myself, and while I had noticed some other
things that needed to be corrected in it and' had prepared some
amendments to that end I did not notice what the gentleman
from Massachusetts has just called my attention to. I would

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE.

MAClH-. 30,

suggest, 1s the gentleman, from Massachusetts sees the purpose
of section 2, that, perhaps, he can suggest an amendment to
cover lils objection.    ...
Air. REED of West Virginia. , Mr. Chairman, will th'e gentle-
man yield?
Mr. GREEN ot Iowa. Yes.
Mr. REED of \\Vest Virginia. As a matter of fact, will it not
just go back and reduce from the 8-cent to the 5-cent limit, and
we shall go ahead under the 5-cent liuitation? That 'Will be
the effect.
Mr. DEMPSEY. Mr. Chairman, will the gentleman yield?
Mr. WALISH. Yes; I yield to tile geintleman from Iowa.
Mr. 1EMPSEY. How would this answer the purpose: After
the word "purposes" insert " as it read and existed prior to
the amendment made by section 1. hereof"?
Mr. MANN of Illinois. Or "prior to the. passage of this act."
Mr. DEMPSEY. Yes; or "prior to the passage of this act."
That would be better. Why would not that answer the pur.-
pose? "As it read and was enforced" would probably be better
than" as.it existed."
Mr. WALSH. Mr. Chairman, I offer an amendment to page.
3, line 4. - After the word " purposes  insert the words, "in
effect prior to the passage of this act."'.
The CHAIRMAN. The gentleman from Massachusetts offers
an amendment, which the Clerk will report.
Mr. WALSH. "As in effect prior to the passage of this act."
The Clerk read as follows:
Amendment offered by Mr. WALSH : Page 8, line 4, after thc word
purposes," insert " as in effect prior to the passage of this act.".
The CHAIRMAN. The question is on agreeing to the amend-
ment.
The amendment was agreed to.
Mr. KITCHIN. Now, ir. Chairman, I move to strike out
the last word.
The'CHAIRMAN. The gentleman from North Carolina nmoves
to strike out the last word.
Mr. KITCHIN. Mr.' Chairman, I want to congratulate the
Republican members of the Comm ittee on Ways and Means,
and the Democrats with them, and the Republican membership
of the House, for the consideration and the passage 6f.this'bill.
In my opinion it is needed to give at least some hope of relief
from the distressed condition of the thousands of little country
and little city newspapers throughout'the country. It is almost
an emergency.
I want to congratulate the Republicanson the fact that when-
ever the country faces an emergency, it matters not what it is,
they 'resoit to a Democr-htic policy to' give relief from'that
emergency. [Applause on the Dem6cratic side.] We remember
when the great Chicago fire in 1872 s;}yept away millions of
property and left tens of thousands of people homeless the Re-
publican Congress rushed to a Democratic policy to give relief to
those suffering people by putting building materials on the free
list for a period. [Applause on the Democratic side.]
When the fire at Portland, Me., had laid waste hundreds of
thousands and millions of dollars' worth of property and left
many thousands of people in distress and in suffering and with-
out shelter, the Republican Congress at once again rushed to a
Democratic policy to give those suffering people relief by putting
building materials on the free list for a year. [Applause on
the Democratic side.]
,Again, we remember in the great strike of 1902, when the coal
cormorants had every man, woman, and child in the country
at their mercy; the Republicans, to give relief to a suffering
people, again resorted to a Democratic policy and rushed thiough
a Republican House and a Republican Senate, with the approval
of a Republican President, an act putting coal on the free list.
[Applause on the Democratic side.]
Now, when the little country papers throughout the United
States are in the present struggle and distress, the Republican
Party in a Republican House, with a Republican Senate, rushes
again to a Democratic policy -by passing a free print paper bill
to give these newspapers throughout the country relief. [Ap-
plause on the Democratic side.]
Gentlemen, if Democratic policies are so good and so wise
and so virtuous in relieving the people in times of emergencies,
why in the name of common justice and common sense are they
not good and wise and virtuous enough to have all the time, to
prevent the people from getting into these emergencies? [Ap-
plause on the Democratic side.] I repeat, I congratulate the Re-
publicans on this measure.
Mr. LUCE. Mr. Chairman, may I ask the gentleman from
North Carolina a question?
Mr. KITCHIN. Certainly..
Mr. LUCE. Is it Democratic policy to put dyestuffs on the
free list?

Mr. KITCHIN. Dyestuffs on the free list? Certain dyestuffs;
yes, sir. I want, to say, since the gentleman has mentioned it,
that there is a dyestuff act on the statute books put there by
the Democrats. For 40 or 50 years the Republicans had control
of'the Government, and they never did one single thing to en-
courage the dyestuff industry in the United- States, and it re-
mained for a Democratic House and a Democratic Senate and a
Democratic President in 1916 to put upon the statute books the
first encouraging legislation for, the dyestuff industry -in the
United States. [Applause on the Democratic side.]
.The dyestuff bill which the House recently passed followed that
Democratic policy. If you had not had that Democratic 'example
to go by, you would not have dared to write a bill. Remember,
too, that a dyestuff bill was recommended by a Democratic Presi-
dent in this Congress before you Republicans took a single step.
[Applause on the Democratic side.]
Mr. GREEN of Iowa. Mr. Chairman; .I congratulate my
Democratic friend in having seen the light in relation to dye-
stuffs and putting a Republican tariff on dyestuffs. It is really
delightful to see, in some cases at least, the Democrats coming
around to sound reasoning in the end.
Mr. KITCHIN. If the gentleman will permit, I want to ask
him a question. Did not the gentleman vote for the Democratic
dyestuff provisions in the Democratic bill in 1916, and did not
the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. LoNGWORTH] with him vote for
it, and did not half of the Republicans on the Ways and Means
Committee vote for that Democratic bill which I wrote, and did
not 50 men on the Republican side of the House vote for that
bill in 1916?
Mr. GREEN of Iowa. Whenever you, come to the point of
adopting protective principles and propose. to put on a pro-
tective tariff, we will vote with you every time.
Mr. KITCHIN. But a large majority of your party voted
against you and. me then. But I recognize the fact that you
were more patriotic than a majority of your colleagues. You
must admit that the Democratic Party was the first one to put
through any legislation in aid of the dyestuff industry, whether
you call it a protective tariff or an encouraging tariff or a tariff
for revenue with incidental protection.
Mr. LONGWORTH. Mr. Chairman, I merely desire to sug-
gest to the gentleman from North Carolina that the Democratic
Party were forced at last to come to the Republican policy, be-
cause they took the rates as provided in the so-called Hill bill
and passed that bill, a Republican tariff measure.
Mr. KITCHIN. If the gentleman will permit, instead of that
being the fact we turned down in committee Mr. Hill's bill
and the House turned it down. The RECORD will show that Mr.
Hill himself got up on this floor and said that the bill which
we Democrats proposed, and for which bill Mr. LONGWORTHI1
and  ir. GREEN of Iowa voted with me, would not amount to
anything, that it would destroy all the dyestuff establishments
in this country; and he offered his bill as a substitute, but it
was overwhelmingly defeated.
Mr. LONGWORTH. It is true that I voted for the bill at the
same time the gentleman from North Carolina did, but I voted
for it because he came more than halfway to me, which is as
much as we can possibly expect of a Democrat.
Mr. KITCHIN. You Republicans had never gone halfway or
any other way on the dyestuff bill. [Applause on the Demo-
cratic side.] We Democrats went all the Way and passed one.
[Applause on the Democratic side.]
Mr. GREEN of Iowa. Mr. Chairman, I believe I have the
floor. The gentleman from North Carolina is a little bit late in
his dates. The proposition to put a tariff on dyestuffs was first
proposed by the distinguished gentleman from Connecticut, Mr.
Hill, and then the Democrats, as usual, came trailing in after-
wards when they saw that it was a good proposition, and they
established a protective tariff to a certain extent. When they
were in control we had to take what we could get. If we could
not get what we wanted, we voted for as much protection as we
could get.
Mr. KITCHIN. If the gentleman will. just go back to the
RECORD and will see the facts, lie will find that the bill for which
he and I voted together is as different from the Hill bill as light
is from darkness. The gentleman has got it all mi:=ed up in his
memory. The gentleman was right then, and I will ask him-not
to impeach his record by trying to get out of the right position
that he then took. [Laughter.]
Mr."GREEN of Iowa. I would rather.trust to the RscoRo
than to the vivid imagination of the gentleman from North Caro-
lina, which I have often found to be defective in the phst.
Mr. Chairman, I move that the committee do now rise and
report the bill to the House with a favorable recommendation.
Mr. HASTINGS. I will ask the gentleman to withhold that
motion for a homent.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE.

Mr. GREEN of Iowa. I yield to the gentleman from Okla-
homa.
Mr. HASTINGS. I move to strike out section 2.
The CHAIRMAN. The gentleman from Oklahoma offers an
amendment, which the Clerk will report.
The Clerk read as follows:
"Amendment offered by Mr. HASTINGS : Page 3, lines.1 to 5, strike out
all of section 2.
Mr. HASTINGS.. Mir. Chairman, if this is good legislation
for one year, it is good legislation for two years and it is good
legislation indefinitely. It is agreed here that this legislation
will not help the big papers, which have made their contracts
for the coming year, but that this legislation is in the interest
of the small papers.
Mr. GREEN of Iowa. Mr. Chairman, just a word on that
subject. The conditions that prevail to-day are .abnormal.
They are not likely to exist very long. I hope they will not
exist very long-not any considerable term of years. If I
thought that the conditions which prevail to-day were likely to
continue indefinitely, I would introduce an altogether different
kind of a bill. This is to remedy this special situation. I think
the amendment ought to be voted down.
The CHAIRMAN. Tie question is o~n the amendment offered
by the gentleman from Oklahoma [Mr. HASTINGS].
The question being taken, on a- division (demanded by Mr.
HASTINGS) there were-ayes 28, noes 57.
Accordingly the amendment was rejected.
Mr. GREEN of Iowa. I move that the committee do now rise
and report the bill to the House with the amendments, with the
recommendation that the amendments be agreed to and that the
bill as amended do pass.
The motion was agreed to.
Accordingly the committee rose; and Mr. WALSH having
taken the chair afs Speaker pro tempore, Mr. CAMPBELL of Kan-
sas, Chairman of the Committee of the Whole House on the
state of the Union, reported that that committee, having had
under consideration the bill (H. R. 12260) to amend section 600
of the act approved September 8, 1916, entitled "An act to in-
crease the *revenue, and for other purposes," had directed him to
report the same back to the House with sundi'y amendments,
with the recommendation that the amendments be agreed to
and that the bill as amended do pass.
Mr. GREEN of Iowa.' I move the previous question on the
bill and amendments to final passage.
The previous question was ordered.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is a separate vote demanded
on any amendment?
Mr. MANN of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I demand a separate
vote on the amendment to section 2, striking out two years and
inserting one year in lieu thereof;
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Illinois
demands a separate vote upon the amendment to page 3, line 2,
striking out " two years " and inserting " one year."
Is a separate vote demanded on any other amendment? If
not, the Chair will put the other amendments in gross.
The other amendments were agreed to.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question now comes upon
the amendment on which the gentleman from Illinois demands
a separate vote. The Clerk will report the amendment.
The clerk read as follows:
Page 3, line 2, strike out the words ' two years" and insert In lieu
thereof the words " one year."
The question being taken, the Speaker pro tempore announced
that the noes appeared to hai'e it.
Mr. LONGWORTH. Division, Mr. Speaker.
Mr. MANN of Illinois. I nmake the point of order that there
is no quorum present.
The SPEAKER pro temnpore. The gentleman from Illinois
nmakes the point of order that there is no quorum present.
Evidently there is no quorun present. TheDoorkeeper will close
the doors, the Sergeant at Arms will notify-absentees. As many
as favor the amendment will, as their names are called, answer
yea," those opposed " nay," and the Clerk will call the roll.
The question was taken; and there were-yeas 60, nays 255,
